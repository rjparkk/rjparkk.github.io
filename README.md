# Data Analysis Portfolio by Richard Park

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. 

## Classification Models

### Real Estate Price Predictions: Multiple Linear Regression 

[Github](https://github.com/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Real_Estate_Price_Prediction.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Real_Estate_Price_Prediction.ipynb)

Real Estate Price Predictions: This is a regression problem: Based on information gathered from [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/city/6283/NJ/Fort-Lee), we predict their prices.

The dataset has a lot of features and many missing values. This gives interesting possibilities for feature transformation and data visualization. 


### Diabetes Prediction: Logistic Regression

[Github](https://github.com/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb)

The objective of the dataset is to build a predictive model using Logistic Regression, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. This model will be compared in the next notebook. 

The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 


### Diabetes Prediction: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

[Github](https://github.com/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Diabetes_Prediction_KNN.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Diabetes_Prediction_KNN.ipynb)

The objective of the dataset is to build a predictive model using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Then the model's predicting capabilities is compared to the logistic regression model made in the previous notebook. 

The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
