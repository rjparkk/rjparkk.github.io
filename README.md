# Data Analysis Portfolio by Richard Park

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. 

## Regression Models

### Real Estate Price Predictions: Multiple Linear Regression 

[Github](https://github.com/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Real_Estate_Price_Prediction.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Real_Estate_Price_Prediction.ipynb)

Real Estate Price Predictions: This is a regression problem: Based on information gathered from [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/city/6283/NJ/Fort-Lee), we predict their prices.

The [dataset](https://github.com/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Datasets/fortlee-properties.csv) has a lot of features and many missing values. This gives interesting possibilities for feature transformation and data visualization. 


### Diabetes Prediction: Logistic Regression

[Github](https://github.com/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb)

The objective of the dataset is to build a predictive model using Logistic Regression, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. This model will be compared in the next notebook. 

The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 

## Classification Models

### Diabetes Prediction: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

[Github](https://github.com/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Diabetes_Prediction_KNN.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Diabetes_Prediction_KNN.ipynb)

The objective of the dataset is to build a predictive model using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Then the model's predicting capabilities is compared to the logistic regression model made in the previous notebook. 

The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 

### Decision Tree Models & Model Optimization

[Github](https://github.com/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Wine_Decision_Tree_Models.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Wine_Decision_Tree_Models.ipynb)

The objective is to build different models to predict quality of wines (Logistic Regression, kNN, and Random Forest Models). The 3 Models are compared to see which is most effecient at predicting the quality of wine.

The dataset is available on [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) 

## Neural networks

### ANN Model 

[Github](https://github.com/rjparkk/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Marketing_Campaign_Response_Prediction.ipynb.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rjparkk.github.io/blob/main/Notebook/Marketing_Campaign_Response_Prediction.ipynb.ipynb)

The objective is to build an ANN model using the bank marketing dataset, focusing on the target variable, "personal loan," reflects whether a customer accepted a personal loan offer.

The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sriharipramod/bank-loan-classification)
