Today, the government’s solution to a future tsunami is to build an even bigger and longer seawall to protect Japan’s coastal communities.Up to 14 metres high and 400 kilometres long, the new seawall is dividingcommunities, and some fear, placing them in greater danger.In this ARTE documentary, presented by former ABC Japan correspondent Mark Willacy, The Great Wall of Japan travels along the north-eastern coast of Japan’s main island to meet the fishermen and communities affected by one of the country’s biggest ever construction projects.Oyster farmer Atsushi Fujita has mixed feelings about the wall, saying it’s destroying his community’s livelihood and culture.“We're all very sad that our former lifestyle has gone and we can no longer see the ocean from our windows. It's really affecting us a lot.”In the village of Akahama, fisherman Hiromi Kawaguchi has galvanised locals against the building of a giant wall. While he lost his wife and mother to the 2011 tsunami, he has no faith a new seawall will protect locals in the event of another great wave.“In the last tsunami, the old wall was destroyed and its remains were left floating on the surface like cubes of tofu. Everything man-made is destined to be destroyed. It’s inevitable.”But others support the wall, including construction executive Kazunori Yamamoto, who believes the old seawall saved his family in 2011.“The breakwater earned us precious time, enabling a lot of people to escape. Without the breakwater, my whole family would have died.”Scientists are divided on the benefits. Some say the wall will slow a tsunami’s advance, allowing more time for people to escape. Others say it will do the opposite, providing a false sense of security, delaying departure and putting people in greater danger.Some believe the 13 billion US dollars spent on the wall’s construction could have been better used moving more communities to higher ground.As Japan commemorates the tsunami’s 10th anniversary, this is a moving and timely story from the region hardest hit by the 2011 disaster.About Foreign Correspondent: Foreign Correspondent is the prime-time international public affairs program on Australia's national broadcaster, ABC-TV.

The outbreak has only exacerbated the challenges at malls as social distancing has placed restrictions on stores, movie theaters and restaurants. So what will become of malls in America after the pandemic ends?Shopping malls across the U.S. have been reeling as restaurant and retail tenants struggle to keep their doors open.Data compiled by Coresight Research shows about a quarter of U.S. malls could close over the next three to five years, accelerating a trend that began before the pandemic.Simon Property Group — the nation's biggest mall owner — said earlier this month that its fourth-quarter revenue dropped by 24% on a year-over-year basis to $1.1 billion.However, some analysts think Simon — with its portfolio of A-rated malls and a healthy balance sheet — will benefit as distressed malls operated by its rivals close their doors. The company is also expected to see gains from new additions like hotels and luxury residences.Unfortunately there are a lot of centers that don't fit that high profile and that have lost their competitive edge, said Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Goldfarb. The thing about Simon is they've been really focused on maintaining it, and that's both been through a combination of culling the lower productive centers as well as making sure that they keep investing in their top centers.Simon Property Group CEO David Simon said the company is also getting a lift from increasing traffic at some of its locations and from tenants paying their rent on time.Malls are a big tax driver for the communities they serve and employ lots of people locally. Watch the video above to find out more about the struggles U.S. malls face and what could become of them after the pandemic ends.» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

If we were really serious people, we might get on our soapbox and pontificate about the pitfalls of capitalism. But we're not really serious people. So we got some googley-eye glasses (thanks Amazon Prime!) and made this video instead.It's our goal to make the best things. If we tried to make the cheapest things, we wouldn't be us. Amazon reminded us of that. We appreciate the pep talk, Amazon.Know what we really appreciate? Our customers. Thank you for supporting intense, obsessive design that focuses on novel solutions to real problems. Thank you for supporting design practices that account for a product's lifecycle, and it's external impact on people and the planet.And if you want to know why Amazon just couldn't resist copying the Peak Design Everyday Sling, check it out for yourself: https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/everyday-bags/products/everyday-sling?variant=29742302068780"

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Bobby Carter | March 3, 2021Jack Harlow's Tiny Desk (home) concert feels like the arrival of a rap superstar. Tucked in a homey-looking space in Los Angeles surrounded by bookshelves and vintage furniture, the Louisville, Ky., emcee delivers a performance with the confidence of an old pro. His set, however, is the first time he's relied solely on live instrumentation to bring his songs to life. It's been a long time since I had a chance to perform and I've never done it like this, he says.This is a far stretch from the kid with loose curls and specs frolicing with his hometown friends, but his success should serve as a reminder of the importance of artist development. He's been able to slow cook for a few years, consistently dropping mixtapes and visuals until he landed a big hit last year in WHATS POPPIN. That performance earned him a Grammy nomination ahead of his very impressive debut album, Thats What They All Say.For this turn at the Tiny Desk, Harlow, his band and some background singers deliver a megamix of highlights from the album. The orchestration underscores his sentimental and introspective side on songs like Same Guy and Funny Seeing You Here, but it also elevates the melody, which is the true hero here. Over the past few years, the 22-year-old rapper has steadily ticked the boxes for a successful career, and this showing undoubtedly checks the performer section.SET LISTRendezvous21C / DeltaFunny Seeing You HereSame GuyCreme/ONCE MAY COMESWhats PoppinMUSICIANSJack Harlow: vocalsO'Neil Doctor O Palmer: keysRico Nichols: drumsJoe Cleveland - bassRob Gueringer: guitarErik B: vocalsChimera Patrice: vocalsPorcha Clay: vocalsCREDITSVideo: Ace Pro, Chadrick Fellers / WastedPotential, Donald Turner, Karis West, Kylie HazzardAudio: Nickie Jon Pabón, CJ BlairPlayback: Kenny WoodsBackline: Jonathan CastilloTINY DESK TEAMProducer: Bobby CarterVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle SmithAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia SternExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann#jackharlow #tinydesk #hiphop #nprmusic"

Pop music sensation Nick Jonas reclaims his red chair alongside superstar returning coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend, and Blake Shelton for Season 20. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named “The Voice” and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.

For a medium large pan around ¼ to ⅓ cup of batter will be enough. For a 37 foot pan you'll need ten gallons of batter Cook until crispy crusticles start to form LiftBlowGrab FlipBut you can probably skip blowing and also don't use your fingers if you're worried about burning yourself. Just use a spatula or try to flip it in the pan...but honestly good luck lol you're not that good at flipping. Cook the other side just a bit and then you know, stuff it or roll stuff in it, or fold stuff in it, or make crepe origami. Your call"

It shares its platform and tech with the Porsche, but Audi is pitching it as more of a cruiser than an outright sports car... just one that happens to have supercar-shaming performance. With up to 637bhp available, it's not just the first Audi RS model to be pure electric, it's also the most powerful to ever wear the RS badge. Top Gear Magazine editor Jack Rix, is among the first to drive one and deliver his verdict. As a bonus, we also speak to tech-reviewer Marques Brownlee about his thoughts on Audi's new offering, and EVs in general. Marques is one of YouTube's top tech-experts and, as we reveal in the film, soon to be a new regular contributor to Top Gear Magazine with monthly written reviews on new electrified cars.

Pop music sensation Nick Jonas reclaims his red chair alongside superstar returning coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend, and Blake Shelton for Season 20. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named “The Voice” and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.

Brandon, Chad, Fred and Channing open up the discussion talking about the sudden loss of friend and former NFL player Vincent Jackson and how he was found days after passing away. Did anyone check on him? Brandon poses the question which leads him into doing a mental check-in with all the guys. In a special moment of vulnerability and raw emotion, the guys are brought to tears as they sit and talk about deep life discussions. The guys talk about how there's a stigma in society that men and young boys are always raised to be tough and not show emotion or the world will look at you differently. With athletes, that notion is instilled by coaches and teammates saying tears are a sign of weakness when in fact it shouldn't be viewed that way. Being strong is part of dealing with emotions and being able to share with others what's truly going on inside your mind and heart. After recently losing his mother Hurricane Paula Johnson, Chad opens up about their relationship and how he's struggled with the emotions tied to loss. Recounting the memories and leading up to her final days, Chad is very transparent that the relationship was unique in many factors but he wouldn't have had it any other way. “It hurts to lose the person responsible for who I am,” Chad says, as he breaks down which brings Brandon and Channing to tears too. Fred follows it up saying that sometimes things in life are bigger than sports and different from what people portray on the outside, we all go through things and it's ok to let that emotion out. After a group hug of comfort and reassurance, Chef Nancie comes out and opens up about tragically losing her brother years ago and how the pain never fades but the good memories help make it easier to cope.

That website is kinda sketchy too for making a tier list. I wanted to make a tier list and it wanted me to sign up with a twitter account and requested ALL ACCESS to my twitter account. And there's no other website that lets you make tier lists so I just made a different twitter account so that I could make the tier list anyway. And it's only shady for making tier lists you can use tier lists for free without account access.Also I am so tired cuz I needed to get this video done by literally today and I procrastinated a ton and stayed up really late to make sure it was finished. Idk why I do these things to myself. But it was a fun video so whatever! I always feel like I am worried about telling a story correctly and making sure it makes sense but for this I'm literally just ranking doors. No pressure at all. And that made it more enjoyable to make. I just need to get better about procrastination is all.thanks for watching ❤️ hope you liked it.(new merch is happening so I won't plug what I have now)📱 twitter:https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy📷 instagram:https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/DISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.

Pop music sensation Nick Jonas reclaims his red chair alongside superstar returning coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend, and Blake Shelton for Season 20. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named “The Voice” and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.
