"OBPNm4jY1PU","What A Body Language Expert Noticed In Meghan's Oprah Interview","2021-03-08T20:21:39Z","UCJ7dtuZhjFSJvb_CZjWJkng","The List","24","21.09.03","the list|meghan markle|oprah|prince harry|body language","103023","985","331","482","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OBPNm4jY1PU/default.jpg","False","False","After two years of feeling silenced by palace authorities, Meghan Markle finally came forward to tell her side of the story on the special Oprah with Meghan and Harry on Sunday night. Impeccably clad in a black-and-white wrap dress, the Duchess of Sussex talked with her friend Oprah Winfrey about her life in and out of the palace. As promised, no subject was off-limits, including discussion about rumors that she had made Kate Middleton cry over an incident before her wedding. She discussed her feelings over learning that son Archie would not be named a prince and would not receive security, and ‚Äî perhaps most shockingly ‚Äî revealed that at her lowest point, she felt she didn't want to be alive anymore.  Meghan also denied being the leading player in the couple's decision to relinquish their senior royal status and pursue their own life and goals in the relative privacy of their new California home. Some royal watchers have long claimed that the duchess is claiming victimhood to cover up her own ambitions and agenda. Bustle reports that several of them weighed in on the Oprah interview even before it aired, claiming she was putting on a good show in front of a friend asking softball questions. The quotes were gathered by a pair of social experimenters curious to see whether the royal experts would comment on something they hadn't seen. So was Meghan's apparent vulnerability all an act? One expert offers some thoughts. The List spoke to Mark Bowden, a human behavior and body language expert who is also a panelist on The Behavior Panel. He watched Meghan's gestures and facial expressions, and what he found might come as a surprise to the palace loyalists. Bowden notes that the duchess seemed most open and expressive when she was talking about the wedding vows she and Harry exchanged three days before the big royal ceremony. He says, When remembering happy events, she is big and bold with her gestures. But her body language when talking about less pleasant matters was even more telling. Suppressing the lips or putting a hand to one's mouth can indicate you're trying not to say too much; Meghan did both when talking about her naivet√© about marrying royalty, and again when she talked about unnamed palace individuals who hadn't been supportive of her. As Meghan recalled feeling unprotected from the media, she lowered her head and covered her eyes; Bowden says this indicates she was feeling, Either shame she feels about not being protected, or shame about how she now feels towards the institution for not protecting her. She showed indications of stress, such as swallowing and rapid breathing, when discussing such uncomfortable topics as her suicidal thoughts and racism within the Firm. What about the account of her conflict with Kate? Meghan told Oprah that in fact, it was Kate who made her cry that day. Bowden says that Meghan's vocal tones and increased blinking indicate the story is true. Throughout the two-hour long special, the Duchess of Sussex displayed real emotions between the movement of her eyes, mouth and forehead. When she talked about the South Africa tour in which she infamously told a reporter that she was not okay, her facial expressions gave away her duress. Bowden notes that her, Blink rate [was] up on talking about tour of South Africa and the pain she was feeling. As things worsened within the family, Markle revealed, she discovered that her son would not receive the protection that she would have liked. During this segment of their conversation, Markle's forehead told the story of how painful that exchange was for her. Bowen even notes that her forehead movements showed, The grief around how she was told her son was not going to be protected. Once the discussion around her mental health struggles began, it was Markle's breathing that spoke volumes. Bowen adds, [Her] breathing rate [was] high as she recovered from telling the story of thinking about suicide. Viewers also watched as her eyes welled with tears and she explained how trapped and lonely she felt within her confines in the institution. Luckily, Markle's husband showed his support throughout the interview, with Bowen even noting their close touch. Meghan's thumb rubs Harry's hand in soothing gestures. The Duchess also had another ally in her interviewer. Bowen says, By the end of the interview Oprah and Megan are mirroring each other almost exactly. [...] Hand to face ‚Äî finger curled below lip. Very sympathetic to each other.#MeghanMarkle #Oprah #BodyLanguageRead Full Article: https://www.thelist.com/349898/what-a-body-language-expert-noticed-in-meghan-markles-oprah-interview/"

And then finally we have the Porsche, which has a 3.8-litre flat-six turbo to produce 650hp & 800Nm. So, there's one thing they have in common - they‚Äôre all absolutely awesome machines! But of course, there can only be one winner - so who‚Äôs your money on? We know how quick the 911 Turbo is, so it may be a foregone conclusion when it comes to who snatches the win... But could Mat snatch second place from Yianni in the Audi R8?There‚Äôs only one way to find out‚Ä¶ LET‚ÄôS RACE!Thanks to CS Panda for lending us their GT-R NISMO - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxwBVsAoWWkQjKmSKOx5u2A.............................................................Instagram ‚Äì http://www.instagram.com/carwowTiktok - https://www.tiktok.com/@carwowFacebook ‚Äì http://www.facebook.com/carwowukTwitter ‚Äì http://www.twitter.com/carwowukSign Up to our Newsletter ‚Äì http://bit.ly/carwow-NewsletterAwkward haggling is a thing of the past with carwow.

Similar to the high-altitude flight tests of Starship SN8 and SN9, SN10 will be powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee ‚Äì approximately 10 km in altitude. SN10 will perform a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent.  The Starship prototype will descend under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship‚Äôs attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. SN10‚Äôs Raptor engines will then reignite as the vehicle attempts a landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down on the landing pad adjacent to the launch mount. A controlled aerodynamic descent with body flaps and vertical landing capability, combined with in-space refilling, are critical to landing Starship at destinations across the solar system where prepared surfaces or runways do not exist, and returning to Earth. This capability will enable a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.  Given the dynamic schedule of development testing, stay tuned to our social media channels for updates as we move toward SpaceX‚Äôs third high-altitude flight test of Starship!"

Many went without power or water, in subzero temperatures, for nearly five days. It was a disaster; dozens died. But even though that storm hit much of the country, the power outages were mostly limited to Texas. That‚Äôs because Texas is on its own electrical grid, separate from the rest of the country, which means it can‚Äôt easily get power from other states in an emergency.But Texas's grid itself is not what failed. Power went out across Texas in the first place because energy sources across the state were unprepared for severe weather. And that didn‚Äôt have to happen; Texas had been warned about this exact scenario, and had actually experienced versions of it twice in the last 30 years. But they didn‚Äôt prepare.Now the rest of the US faces the same issue. Climate change is making severe weather disasters more and more frequent. And the American energy system is not ready for it.Read more about what happened in Texas and about the US electrical grid: https://www.vox.com/22289517/texas-storm-uri-weather-power-outage-snowAnd check out more coverage of the Texas power crisis from the Texas Tribune: https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/22/texas-power-grid-extreme-weather/Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

We've been selling Peak Design products on Amazon for years, and we work closely with Amazon to remove counterfeit and copycat products from their marketplace. Hence, we were astonished when we found out Amazon had copied one of our bestselling bags. They call it the Everyday Sling, which, funny enough, is exactly what we call our product.Amazon is a revolutionary service that we use and benefit from heavily. Also, Peak Design is not the first brand to see their products copied by an Amazon in-house brand. If we were really serious people, we might get on our soapbox and pontificate about the pitfalls of capitalism. But we're not really serious people. So we got some googley-eye glasses (thanks Amazon Prime!) and made this video instead.It's our goal to make the best things. If we tried to make the cheapest things, we wouldn't be us. Amazon reminded us of that. We appreciate the pep talk, Amazon.Know what we really appreciate? Our customers. Thank you for supporting intense, obsessive design that focuses on novel solutions to real problems. Thank you for supporting design practices that account for a product's lifecycle, and it's external impact on people and the planet.And if you want to know why Amazon just couldn't resist copying the Peak Design Everyday Sling, check it out for yourself: https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/everyday-bags/products/everyday-sling?variant=29742302068780"
