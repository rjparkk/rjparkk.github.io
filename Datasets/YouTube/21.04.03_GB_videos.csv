Similar to the high-altitude flight tests of Starship SN8 and SN9, SN10 will be powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee ‚Äì approximately 10 km in altitude. SN10 will perform a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent.  The Starship prototype will descend under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship‚Äôs attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. SN10‚Äôs Raptor engines will then reignite as the vehicle attempts a landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down on the landing pad adjacent to the launch mount. A controlled aerodynamic descent with body flaps and vertical landing capability, combined with in-space refilling, are critical to landing Starship at destinations across the solar system where prepared surfaces or runways do not exist, and returning to Earth. This capability will enable a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.  Given the dynamic schedule of development testing, stay tuned to our social media channels for updates as we move toward SpaceX‚Äôs third high-altitude flight test of Starship!"

We've been selling Peak Design products on Amazon for years, and we work closely with Amazon to remove counterfeit and copycat products from their marketplace. Hence, we were astonished when we found out Amazon had copied one of our bestselling bags. They call it the Everyday Sling, which, funny enough, is exactly what we call our product.Amazon is a revolutionary service that we use and benefit from heavily. Also, Peak Design is not the first brand to see their products copied by an Amazon in-house brand. If we were really serious people, we might get on our soapbox and pontificate about the pitfalls of capitalism. But we're not really serious people. So we got some googley-eye glasses (thanks Amazon Prime!) and made this video instead.It's our goal to make the best things. If we tried to make the cheapest things, we wouldn't be us. Amazon reminded us of that. We appreciate the pep talk, Amazon.Know what we really appreciate? Our customers. Thank you for supporting intense, obsessive design that focuses on novel solutions to real problems. Thank you for supporting design practices that account for a product's lifecycle, and it's external impact on people and the planet.And if you want to know why Amazon just couldn't resist copying the Peak Design Everyday Sling, check it out for yourself: https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/everyday-bags/products/everyday-sling?variant=29742302068780"

As you may have seen in her Prrbbtt compilation video (https://youtu.be/RUJgP2w874c), Shorty usually does her little hi activation sound when I walk by and see her in her box, er, I mean, Her Royal Meowjesty's Secret Fortress. But here she does it in succession when I was playing peek-a-boo with her. Yes I play peek-a-boo with my cat so what. I thought it was funny, so I wanted this as part of the ShoKo Shorts playlist. Hope everyone's doing great out there!Peace and purrs out,RobShirts: https://teespring.com/stores/the-shoko-shopPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/shortyandkodiYouTube Memberships: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsCFq6T-ut6mRvC5MlZmjkw/joinBook: http://mybook.to/shoshankredemptionInstagram: http://instagram.com/ShortyandKodiFacebook: http://facebook.com/ShortyandKodiTwitter: http://twitter.com/ShortyandKodiTik Tok: https://tiktok.com/@shortyandkodi"

Click https://www.carwow.co.uk/-help-me-carwow and my team and I will help you choose your ideal car at a fair price - from Mat Watson!.............................................................Introducing the all-new Volkswagen Golf R! Mat‚Äôs finally got his hands on VW‚Äôs latest hot hatch to see if the Golf R really is the ultimate car for grown up boy racers.Given it‚Äôs a hot hatch, the first thing we need to investigate is the performance! Under the bonnet, you‚Äôll find a 2-litre turbocharged engine (the same as in the Mk7‚Ä¶), although this time it‚Äôll produce 320hp and 420Nm of torque, while also being able to hit 60mph in 4.7 seconds.So the performance stats are ok, but do we really think it‚Äôs worth the approximate ¬£40,000 price tag? And more importantly, will Mat be able to beat the claimed 0-60mph time?

That website is kinda sketchy too for making a tier list. I wanted to make a tier list and it wanted me to sign up with a twitter account and requested ALL ACCESS to my twitter account. And there's no other website that lets you make tier lists so I just made a different twitter account so that I could make the tier list anyway. And it's only shady for making tier lists you can use tier lists for free without account access.Also I am so tired cuz I needed to get this video done by literally today and I procrastinated a ton and stayed up really late to make sure it was finished. Idk why I do these things to myself. But it was a fun video so whatever! I always feel like I am worried about telling a story correctly and making sure it makes sense but for this I'm literally just ranking doors. No pressure at all. And that made it more enjoyable to make. I just need to get better about procrastination is all.thanks for watching ‚ù§Ô∏è hope you liked it.(new merch is happening so I won't plug what I have now)üì± twitter:https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuyüì∑ instagram:https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/DISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.

Today we‚Äôre going to Charcoal Tandoor Grill, an Indian restaurant that specializes in all food cooked in the tandoor oven. From kebabs, to dal, to the biggest naan I‚Äôve ever seen - literally the size of the table or blanket - we‚Äôre going to feast on an amazing tandoori meal!Charcoal Tandoor Grill - They have a great concept, focus on serving food, all food, cooked in the tandoor oven. And as Prerak the manager explained to me, the restaurant also has roots in rural areas of India where people living in villages would hunt for game, and then roast everything in a fire, sharing with the community. They also only use charcoal tandoor clay ovens, no gas fires, which I think makes a huge difference in the taste and quality of the food.We ordered a huge mix of tandoori specialties including an entire leg of lamb, chicken kebabs, a tandoori lobster, dal Charcoal style, biryani, and finally the massive family sized naan.The food was extraordinary, you could taste the thick layers of spices and marinades, and the layers of smokiness from the tandoor cooking process. What I love so much about tandoori food is that the fire is so hot, and so it scorches the outside, yet the insides of what you cook remains so juicy and tender. This was the case for everything we ate. Really outstanding and tasty food.Next, we had one of their famous biryanis. To be honest I was blown away, the fragrance and fluffiness was out of control. The tenderness of the lamb just melted in your mouth. Highly recommended to go with your kebabs.Finally, for dessert we had what they call ‚Äúthe tree of life,‚Äù a mango tree filled with mangoes that were shaped into mangoes, yet made from Indian alphonso mangoes and soy milk and froze. It was a perfect way to end this amazing Indian food meal in Bangkok.NOTE: This video is not sponsored, I arranged to eat here and film a video because I had heard great things about their tandoori food and their giant naan. However, after I asked for the bill, they insisted that I not pay for our meal. That being said prices range from about 400 - 600 THB per dish, with the lamb and lobster being about 1,500 THB each.üìç Charcoal Tandoor Grill: https://goo.gl/maps/GhH1b3Vz5ioSKZdu6üéµMUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîüçå100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5züëïGet t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîüì±FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"
