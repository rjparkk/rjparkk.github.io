The video footage garnered using various devices, including smartphones, was then sent to Anno and staff in Japan for finishing.Hope you enjoy this finished piece, it's a little bit bittersweet, and like revisiting intimate and precious memories from times past.[About “Evangelion: New Theatrical Edition”]TV anime series “Neon Genesis EVANGELION” was first broadcast in 1995, taking the world by storm.The “Evangelion: New Theatrical Edition” film series started in 2007 with EVANGELION: 1.0 YOU ARE (NOT) ALONE. followed by “EVANGELION: 2.0 YOU CAN (NOT) ADVANCE.” and “EVANGELION: 3.0 YOU CAN (NOT) REDO. “all becoming record hits at the box office.The TV anime and each of the feature films have since continued to garner new fans and are very lucky to be popular among various generations along the way, and the newest and feature film finale will release in theaters on March 8, 2021.- Movie trailer : https://youtu.be/d8mf0qDD3Qg- Check out the daily countdown to the new film release with the Official smartphone app EVA-EXTRAGet a special digital coupon to use at the EVANGELION STORE!https://www.eva-info.jp/eva-extra/- Evangelion series Official site : https://www.evangelion.co.jp/- Evangelion series Official Twitter account : @evangelion_co- Evangelion series Official Instagram : @evangelion.official"

Um I really hope they held you down I really hope it was no lying 'Cause my heart breaks, it feels like the world's gone But if the love's real, you'd feel your soul roar like a lion And you'd finally let bygones be bygones Don't throw in the towel, I know it feels like you're the only one trying You just gotta learn to live and love on I belong with the one put on this Earth for me Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see I'm screaming out, Lord, help me, I've been lonely That's when you accept me, then you set me free Uh, sometimes life's a mess I get high when I'm upset I remember when me and love didn't click Searching for somethin' real then I found it Uh, sometimes life's a mess Yeah, I get high when I'm upset I remember when me and love ain't click Looking for somethin' real then I found it (Clever) Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody that made promises to give you the world? There’s one that won’t never leave you cold or place nothing above you.. that will love a heart that hurts- don’t hurt the heart that loves you. Sometimes they just want what they can’t have- forbidden fruit. But the one that deserves ya love will never pick and choose. There was once a hole in my heart- that hole was hurting-  til I took a peak inside- lately i’ve been soul searching. When I use to cry I turned to medication- then I found me something real and forgot all the imitations. Just tell me that you’ll never leave. And when there’s nothing left to say. Tell me that you’ll love me anyway ahhh Uh, sometimes life's a mess I get high when I'm upset I remember when me and love didn't click Searching for somethin' real then I found it Uh, sometimes life's a mess Yeah, I get high when I'm upset I remember when me and love ain't click Looking for somethin' real then I found it (Post Malone) Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody  that made promises to give you the world?  And I swear I would never leave you cold There ain’t no one above you.  You were way too high to touch  I was high enough to pass out.  When you was so alone I was a stones throw away.  I remember those lips  I remember how they taste.  I been staring at the wall doing nothing all day.  I remember everything put the bottle to my face- Dom Pe.  If you gave up on me now I would seriously be so fucked up.  I’m doing everything I can just to keep myself from throwing up.  Never gave a fuck what they say bout us.  Fuck all of you muh fuckers slow me up.  and fuck everything that ruined us.  I’m three seconds away from pulling out my gun #JuiceWRLD #Clever #PostMalone"

Many went without power or water, in subzero temperatures, for nearly five days. It was a disaster; dozens died. But even though that storm hit much of the country, the power outages were mostly limited to Texas. That’s because Texas is on its own electrical grid, separate from the rest of the country, which means it can’t easily get power from other states in an emergency.But Texas's grid itself is not what failed. Power went out across Texas in the first place because energy sources across the state were unprepared for severe weather. And that didn’t have to happen; Texas had been warned about this exact scenario, and had actually experienced versions of it twice in the last 30 years. But they didn’t prepare.Now the rest of the US faces the same issue. Climate change is making severe weather disasters more and more frequent. And the American energy system is not ready for it.Read more about what happened in Texas and about the US electrical grid: https://www.vox.com/22289517/texas-storm-uri-weather-power-outage-snowAnd check out more coverage of the Texas power crisis from the Texas Tribune: https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/22/texas-power-grid-extreme-weather/Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The outbreak has only exacerbated the challenges at malls as social distancing has placed restrictions on stores, movie theaters and restaurants. So what will become of malls in America after the pandemic ends?Shopping malls across the U.S. have been reeling as restaurant and retail tenants struggle to keep their doors open.Data compiled by Coresight Research shows about a quarter of U.S. malls could close over the next three to five years, accelerating a trend that began before the pandemic.Simon Property Group — the nation's biggest mall owner — said earlier this month that its fourth-quarter revenue dropped by 24% on a year-over-year basis to $1.1 billion.However, some analysts think Simon — with its portfolio of A-rated malls and a healthy balance sheet — will benefit as distressed malls operated by its rivals close their doors. The company is also expected to see gains from new additions like hotels and luxury residences.Unfortunately there are a lot of centers that don't fit that high profile and that have lost their competitive edge, said Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Goldfarb. The thing about Simon is they've been really focused on maintaining it, and that's both been through a combination of culling the lower productive centers as well as making sure that they keep investing in their top centers.Simon Property Group CEO David Simon said the company is also getting a lift from increasing traffic at some of its locations and from tenants paying their rent on time.Malls are a big tax driver for the communities they serve and employ lots of people locally. Watch the video above to find out more about the struggles U.S. malls face and what could become of them after the pandemic ends.» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

Similar to the high-altitude flight tests of Starship SN8 and SN9, SN10 will be powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 km in altitude. SN10 will perform a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent.  The Starship prototype will descend under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. SN10’s Raptor engines will then reignite as the vehicle attempts a landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down on the landing pad adjacent to the launch mount. A controlled aerodynamic descent with body flaps and vertical landing capability, combined with in-space refilling, are critical to landing Starship at destinations across the solar system where prepared surfaces or runways do not exist, and returning to Earth. This capability will enable a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.  Given the dynamic schedule of development testing, stay tuned to our social media channels for updates as we move toward SpaceX’s third high-altitude flight test of Starship!"

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Bobby Carter | March 3, 2021Jack Harlow's Tiny Desk (home) concert feels like the arrival of a rap superstar. Tucked in a homey-looking space in Los Angeles surrounded by bookshelves and vintage furniture, the Louisville, Ky., emcee delivers a performance with the confidence of an old pro. His set, however, is the first time he's relied solely on live instrumentation to bring his songs to life. It's been a long time since I had a chance to perform and I've never done it like this, he says.This is a far stretch from the kid with loose curls and specs frolicing with his hometown friends, but his success should serve as a reminder of the importance of artist development. He's been able to slow cook for a few years, consistently dropping mixtapes and visuals until he landed a big hit last year in WHATS POPPIN. That performance earned him a Grammy nomination ahead of his very impressive debut album, Thats What They All Say.For this turn at the Tiny Desk, Harlow, his band and some background singers deliver a megamix of highlights from the album. The orchestration underscores his sentimental and introspective side on songs like Same Guy and Funny Seeing You Here, but it also elevates the melody, which is the true hero here. Over the past few years, the 22-year-old rapper has steadily ticked the boxes for a successful career, and this showing undoubtedly checks the performer section.SET LISTRendezvous21C / DeltaFunny Seeing You HereSame GuyCreme/ONCE MAY COMESWhats PoppinMUSICIANSJack Harlow: vocalsO'Neil Doctor O Palmer: keysRico Nichols: drumsJoe Cleveland - bassRob Gueringer: guitarErik B: vocalsChimera Patrice: vocalsPorcha Clay: vocalsCREDITSVideo: Ace Pro, Chadrick Fellers / WastedPotential, Donald Turner, Karis West, Kylie HazzardAudio: Nickie Jon Pabón, CJ BlairPlayback: Kenny WoodsBackline: Jonathan CastilloTINY DESK TEAMProducer: Bobby CarterVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle SmithAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia SternExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann#jackharlow #tinydesk #hiphop #nprmusic"

We've been selling Peak Design products on Amazon for years, and we work closely with Amazon to remove counterfeit and copycat products from their marketplace. Hence, we were astonished when we found out Amazon had copied one of our bestselling bags. They call it the Everyday Sling, which, funny enough, is exactly what we call our product.Amazon is a revolutionary service that we use and benefit from heavily. Also, Peak Design is not the first brand to see their products copied by an Amazon in-house brand. If we were really serious people, we might get on our soapbox and pontificate about the pitfalls of capitalism. But we're not really serious people. So we got some googley-eye glasses (thanks Amazon Prime!) and made this video instead.It's our goal to make the best things. If we tried to make the cheapest things, we wouldn't be us. Amazon reminded us of that. We appreciate the pep talk, Amazon.Know what we really appreciate? Our customers. Thank you for supporting intense, obsessive design that focuses on novel solutions to real problems. Thank you for supporting design practices that account for a product's lifecycle, and it's external impact on people and the planet.And if you want to know why Amazon just couldn't resist copying the Peak Design Everyday Sling, check it out for yourself: https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/everyday-bags/products/everyday-sling?variant=29742302068780"

I went out yesterday to make some video of both of these things, but I also went through my archives over the last month and found some other videos that might be helpful.In short, it seems the black flags are POW/MIA flags that are now required to be flown at the Capitol, the White House, military cemeteries, and post offices due to a law signed by President Trump in 2019. The National POW/MIA Flag Act, Public Law 116-67, was signed by President Trump on November 7, 2019 and should mean you’ll see this flag anytime you see the Capitol or White House on TV, or even when you visit your local post office.The second question was about the buses. Why are their tour buses when there are no tourists? From what I’ve seen, the National Guard has been using these unused tourist buses as a shuttle service. I’ve gone back in my video files over the last month and pulled up some scenes of these buses moving around between the DC National Guard Armory, the Capitol and hotels and other locations downtown. I’ve seen them during the day and at night. Is every single flag flying a POW/MIA flag? Is every single bus I see a National Guard bus?  I can’t possibly know that. No one can. I can only show you what I see during my walks. If you have a specific place you want me to film, hit me up and I’ll try to take a hike down there so you can see it too.Thanks for watching.——————PenguinSix is an apolitical guy in a political town who likes to walk a lot.

He is an American expat who spent the last decade in Hong Kong with his family and is now back in Washington DC, continuing his daily ritual of taking very long hikes around the city catching the sights and sounds of the city while live streaming to share with others.  History, culture, life as an expat (with reverse culture shock), and the patheticness of the Chinese food in Washington DC are regular topics of discussion.

Brandon, Chad, Fred and Channing open up the discussion talking about the sudden loss of friend and former NFL player Vincent Jackson and how he was found days after passing away. Did anyone check on him? Brandon poses the question which leads him into doing a mental check-in with all the guys. In a special moment of vulnerability and raw emotion, the guys are brought to tears as they sit and talk about deep life discussions. The guys talk about how there's a stigma in society that men and young boys are always raised to be tough and not show emotion or the world will look at you differently. With athletes, that notion is instilled by coaches and teammates saying tears are a sign of weakness when in fact it shouldn't be viewed that way. Being strong is part of dealing with emotions and being able to share with others what's truly going on inside your mind and heart. After recently losing his mother Hurricane Paula Johnson, Chad opens up about their relationship and how he's struggled with the emotions tied to loss. Recounting the memories and leading up to her final days, Chad is very transparent that the relationship was unique in many factors but he wouldn't have had it any other way. “It hurts to lose the person responsible for who I am,” Chad says, as he breaks down which brings Brandon and Channing to tears too. Fred follows it up saying that sometimes things in life are bigger than sports and different from what people portray on the outside, we all go through things and it's ok to let that emotion out. After a group hug of comfort and reassurance, Chef Nancie comes out and opens up about tragically losing her brother years ago and how the pain never fades but the good memories help make it easier to cope.

Pop music sensation Nick Jonas reclaims his red chair alongside superstar returning coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend, and Blake Shelton for Season 20. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named “The Voice” and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.

Pop music sensation Nick Jonas reclaims his red chair alongside superstar returning coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend, and Blake Shelton for Season 20. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named “The Voice” and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.

Yes the shade started early after Latoya and Drew bumped heads about what really happened after the cameras went down. And the ladies were definitely really irritated with the whole thing.Kandi Burruss Makes Shocking Revelation About The Bachelorette PartyNow speaking of Kandi, I was shook when she finally sat down with DonJuan after getting back home from the trip. At first she kept it real cute but I can tell she forgot the cameras were there and she eventually shared some stuff with DonJuan that we had never heard before. (Clip: Kenya not lying) Wait a minute Wayment Kandi are you sitting here telling me this whole time you could have spilled this tea 2, 3 episodes ago but yall chose to play in our face instead? I dunno whether to commend her on not throwing Porsha under the bus or to feel some type of way. But either way I’m shook with how this scene played out because DonJuan spilled even more tea that puts Bolo at the scene of the alleged shenanigans. And seeing as tho he was the one arranging Bolo’s car service he seems like a pretty credible source.TOPICS:Watch RHOA Season 13 Episode 11Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 13 Episode 11RHOA Season 13 TrailerTanya Sam CheatingPorsha and Tanya Caught with BOLOIf you want to JOIN today here is the sign up link to become a member! 💜YouTube.com/Bingeworthy/Join*************♡ ♡ ♡ CONNECT WITH ME!!!For business inquiries, sponsorships or PR, please email: justindiegotv@gmail.comBingeworthy Video LLC (Must include this)Attn: Justin Diego730 Peachtree Street NE, #570 Atlanta, GA 30308INSTAGRAM:@JustinDiego@RealHousewivesofAtlantaTWITTER:TheJustinDiego"
