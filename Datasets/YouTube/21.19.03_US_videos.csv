Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Stephen Thompson | March 17, 2021If you were to apply one of those how it started / how it's going memes to Tiny Desk (home) concerts — which began, it turns out, almost exactly one year ago — you'd have, under how it's going, the image of pop superstar Justin Bieber as he and his band perform the world premiere of a new song called Peaches.Peaches will exist in a significantly different form when Bieber drops his new album Justice on Friday — the track will feature guest vocals from GIVEŌN and Daniel Caesar — just as Holy, another song from Justice, opens this set without the presence of guest Chance the Rapper. But Bieber's Tiny Desk set, performed with the aid of We the Band, provides the fullest taste yet (fully 25 percent!) of the singer's sixth album, whose singles have already been streamed hundreds of millions of times.Bieber has had a massive month as he prepares for Justice to drop: March 2021 began with the singer's 27th birthday and recently produced his second career Grammy, as he took the prize for best country duo or group performance for 10,000 Hours with Dan + Shay. It continues with this, his Tiny Desk debut. Friday, the next chapter officially begins.SET LISTHolyPeachesHold OnAnyoneMUSICIANSJustin Bieber: vocals, keysHarv: bassO'Neil Doctor O Palmer: keysDJ Tay James: DJRobert Taylor: drumsJulian McGuire: guitarCREDITSVideo: Nick Demoura, Mike Drew, Rory Kramer, Aaron Kroger, James CokerAudio: Jim Ebdon, Dylan Ely, James Roach, Chris Houghton, Taylor MeyerProduction Manager: Chris GrattonCamera Operators: Austin Wavra, Daniel Mardoyan, Noel GalanLighting Tech: Jim MecseryTINY DESK TEAMProducer: Bobby CarterVideo Producers: Maia Stern, Morgan Noelle SmithAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara FrameExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann#justinbieber #tinydesk #nprmusic #pop #rnb"

I had a little more issue trying to sync the clips together near the end but I managed somehow. Also, I want people to still know that I did use a bot to keep things well sync because I don't intend on hiding that fact since I wanted to make this video as a fun viewing experience while delivering people exposure of new skin mods out there. In addition, I did not cross dissolve transition since one viewer recommended not too since it ruins the flow and while looking at it I have to agree. Even though some character skins didn't get a chance to sing I still made sure to each one gets a different skin while also making them look good in terms of their respected fandom. Overall, another fun video to make and I hope to continue for a little while longer.Mods used in this video:Main Website for these mods comes from GameBananaGenderSwap Picohttps://gamebanana.com/skins/189906Pico 2000shttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/189086BIGGIE CHEESEhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/185500Naruto over Pico!https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188275Kevin from Ed, Edd n eddyhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/186471Hollow knight little ghost over picohttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187525Lyanide Over Picohttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/189193Dream Over Picohttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187992Phil from Riddle Schoolhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/184033Six Over Girlfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/189995Girl Boyfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187090Narancia (JJBA) as BF Modhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/189684Darnell as Boyfriend Modhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185937Scott Pilgrim joins the Funk' (Weeks 1 to 4)https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190882Playable Tankmen!https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185177Pico over GF 2https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190115Jenny from MLAATR over GF!https://gamebanana.com/skins/188614Playable Sans Undertalehttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185286Chara - From UNDERTALE/ DONTFORGEThttps://gamebanana.com/skins/186417Boy Girlfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187658Hornet from Hollow Knight as GF!https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188587Lucifer from HT over gfhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185819Trish Una (JJBA) as GF Modhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/188133DreamSMP Modhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188064Dream girl friendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187290Rapper GF + Nene!https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185273Isabelle BFhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/187686Yu Narukami Boyfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/185032P5 x FNF: Ann Takamaki as Girlfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184829Chiaki Nanami as Girlfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185407Nagito Komaeda over Pico!https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184963FNF Mono Little Nightmares 2https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190163Hajime Hinata over Boyfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185626►Follow Me!Twitter: https://twitter.com/PrizMatex​​#FridayNightFunkin​’"

Onion rings are far better than apple rings, carrot rings, and also rings. Subscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlYhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcookinghttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookinhttp://yousuckatcooking.comBefore we get into the recipe, let's talk safety. A hot pot full of oil is super dangerous. You can deep fry safely but you have to know what you're doing. The first time I tried it, I was dipping my meat thermometer in the oil to keep track of the temperature. This was colossally stupid. You need a dedicated thermometer on your pot so you can watch constantly and so you won't drop it inside. Better yet, a dedicated deep fryer is really the way to go, and you can just read the instruction manual. Long story short, if your oil temperature gets out of control a fire can start, and you can't put it out with water, you either have to smother it or use a fire extinguisher. Also, the oil takes FOREVER to cool down, so many sure anyone in your house knows not to touch it when you're done using it. It also takes FOREVER to heat up so it's super tempting to turn up the temperature, which is a mistake (on my stovetop, 350 F was just below the number 4. Anyway, read this guide if you think you actually want to try deep frying, and then just order onion rings from the bar instead. Deep Fry Safety https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-deep-fry-safelyRecipe Slice some onions and make ringsRemove tapeYeah basically take any onion you like Add ¾ cup of flour and ¼ cup corn starch to a bowl Then add spices; cayenne, chilli powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, whatever. Let's say around a tablespoon total Add around a cup of soda water, more or less, depending on how buck wild you've gone with the spices. One description I read about the thickness is that it should be like thick paint. Heat 3 or so inches of peanut oil to 350 degrees F in a tall sturdy pot (not non stick)Preferably on your back burner so it won't get knocked. If your vessel has handles, make sure they are not sticking out I see a lot of people use their fingers to put things into the oil. I don't like this method because that's too close for comfort. The spider strainer, in my opinion, is the best way to go. The chance of dropping something in the oil is very minimal. If you're going to use tongs, grip tightly, and I don't recommend silicon tipped tongs because they are slippery. You REALLY DON'T WANT TO CAUSE AN OIIL SPLASH So use your spider strainer to lower an undoh ring into the oilAfter a minute or a minute and a half, flip it, then take it out after another minute. Just trust your eyes in terms of how cooked you want it I highly recommend setting a timer each time you put a batch in as it's easy to get distracted for one minute and you really have to have your head in the game for as long as you are deep frying Place onion rings on a wire rack with paper towels underneath. If you don't have a wire rack you can place them on paper towels on a plate or in a bowl When you're all done, move that oil to the back burner if it's not already there (very, very carefully, using oven mitts), and make sure everyone knows not to touch it for a couple hours. Keep your thermometer in there so you know when it's completely cooledThen you can either save it or dispose of it. Here's a helpful guide on how to dispose of the oil...long story short, it will end up in the trash, not the sink or toilet https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-do-i-dispose-of-used-cooking-oil-908995Thanks! I hope you order onion rings from the bar."

The task proves more difficult than Bruce imagined, as each of the recruits must face the demons of their own pasts to transcend that which has held them back, allowing them to come together, finally forming an unprecedented league of heroes. Now united, Batman (Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), and The Flash (Ezra Miller) may be too late to save the planet from Steppenwolf, DeSaad, and Darkseid and their dreadful intentions.Subscribe: http://bit.ly/HBOMaxYouTubeBe the first to know more:HBO Max: https://hbom.ax/YTLike HBO Max on Facebook: http://bit.ly/HBOMaxFacebookFollow HBO Max on Twitter: http://bit.ly/HBOMaxTwitterFollow HBO Max on Instagram: http://bit.ly/HBOMaxInstagramAbout HBO Max: HBO Max is WarnerMedia’s direct-to-consumer offering with 10,000 hours of curated premium content.

She befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together they are able to build a life for themselves on the London streets. One day, Estella’s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute, played by two-time Oscar® winner Emma Thompson (“Howards End,” “Sense & Sensibility”). But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.  Disney’s “Cruella” is directed by Craig Gillespie (“I Tonya”) from a screenplay by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara, story by Aline Brosh McKenna and Kelly Marcel & Steve Zissis. It was produced by Andrew Gunn (“Freaky Friday”), Marc Platt (“Mary Poppins Returns”) and Kristin Burr (“Christopher Robin”), with Emma Stone, Michelle Wright, Jared LeBoff and Glenn Close serving as executive producers. Two-time Oscar®- winning costume designer Jenny Beavan (“Mad Max: Fury Road,” “A Room with a View”) creates the dazzling and imaginative costumes, which take on a life of their own.For more information on “Cruella,” follow us on:Facebook:        https://www.facebook.com/DisneyCruellaDeVil Twitter:             https://twitter.com/cruella  Instagram:       https://www.instagram.com/disneycruella YouTube:         https://youtube.com/disneymovietrailers​Hashtag:          #Cruella"

Other notable performances include an aesthetic throwback to the 70s from Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak's Silk Sonic and Lil Baby's tribute to the Black Lives Matter movement--which featured appearances from Killer Mike, Tamika Mallory and Kendrick Sampson. http://bit.ly/VarietySubscribehttp://www.facebook.com/varietyhttp://www.instagram.com/varietyhttp://www.twitter.com/variety"

We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. It was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎"

This video there are THREE hunters/hitmen instead of just one.This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to survive for 100 minutes, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo tries to prevent me from surviving. Every 10 minutes there is a 10 minute period of invincibility. They can see me through walls, and the world is small. It's a chase, a race, and it's super intense. A lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.If this video gets 1,500,000 likes we'll do it again!Manhunt T-Shirt Details:Each and every Manhunt t-shirt purchased will be assigned a unique number. Limit 10 Manhunt t-shirts per order.In late April after all shirts have been processed, we will randomly select one unique Manhunt t-shirt number for invitation into a 2021 Dream Manhunt video. Dream will announce the associated order number (and perhaps country and initials) via social media. The lucky customer does not need to see the announcement or know their order number, because we will make reasonable attempts to contact the customer using the contact information provided at checkout. Do not fall for scams that ask you to provide sensitive information or click, install or open anything! If contact attempts are not successful or the invitation is not accepted within 2 business days, we will repeat the same process every 2 business days approximately until an invitation is accepted. The non-transferable invitation and video participation have no retail or monetary value for the purchaser of the Manhunt t-shirt which is sold at fair value and is non-refundable. Adequate computer, internet, video and other capabilities will be arranged if necessary for the sole purpose of video participation.Employees and their families are not eligible for selection.Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed runner / survivalist in Minecraft against a killer / assassin / hitmen#MinecraftHitmen"

I knew you were lyingBut I had no courage to leaveAnd I can’t pretend that you and I had never met If moving on means that I should forgetThen even if I could I wouldn’t No matter what the price is I would pay Don’t matter if I should or shouldn’t It wouldn’t even matter anyway Then even if I could I wouldn’t No matter what the price is I would pay Don’t matter if I should or shouldn’t I wouldn’t ever give up anyway Long nights of crying I felt like I was dying every night Rather keep on fighting At least then I got a reason to fight Khaleelekeh ma trouhehYa Albeh ya rouhehBkhabeekeh bejrouhehKhaleeneh ma3akKhaleelekeh ma trouhehYa omri ya rouhehBkhabeekeh bejrouhehI can’t let you go"
