That website is kinda sketchy too for making a tier list. I wanted to make a tier list and it wanted me to sign up with a twitter account and requested ALL ACCESS to my twitter account. And there's no other website that lets you make tier lists so I just made a different twitter account so that I could make the tier list anyway. And it's only shady for making tier lists you can use tier lists for free without account access.Also I am so tired cuz I needed to get this video done by literally today and I procrastinated a ton and stayed up really late to make sure it was finished. Idk why I do these things to myself. But it was a fun video so whatever! I always feel like I am worried about telling a story correctly and making sure it makes sense but for this I'm literally just ranking doors. No pressure at all. And that made it more enjoyable to make. I just need to get better about procrastination is all.thanks for watching ‚ù§Ô∏è hope you liked it.(new merch is happening so I won't plug what I have now)üì± twitter:https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuyüì∑ instagram:https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/DISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.

Today we‚Äôre going to Charcoal Tandoor Grill, an Indian restaurant that specializes in all food cooked in the tandoor oven. From kebabs, to dal, to the biggest naan I‚Äôve ever seen - literally the size of the table or blanket - we‚Äôre going to feast on an amazing tandoori meal!Charcoal Tandoor Grill - They have a great concept, focus on serving food, all food, cooked in the tandoor oven. And as Prerak the manager explained to me, the restaurant also has roots in rural areas of India where people living in villages would hunt for game, and then roast everything in a fire, sharing with the community. They also only use charcoal tandoor clay ovens, no gas fires, which I think makes a huge difference in the taste and quality of the food.We ordered a huge mix of tandoori specialties including an entire leg of lamb, chicken kebabs, a tandoori lobster, dal Charcoal style, biryani, and finally the massive family sized naan.The food was extraordinary, you could taste the thick layers of spices and marinades, and the layers of smokiness from the tandoor cooking process. What I love so much about tandoori food is that the fire is so hot, and so it scorches the outside, yet the insides of what you cook remains so juicy and tender. This was the case for everything we ate. Really outstanding and tasty food.Next, we had one of their famous biryanis. To be honest I was blown away, the fragrance and fluffiness was out of control. The tenderness of the lamb just melted in your mouth. Highly recommended to go with your kebabs.Finally, for dessert we had what they call ‚Äúthe tree of life,‚Äù a mango tree filled with mangoes that were shaped into mangoes, yet made from Indian alphonso mangoes and soy milk and froze. It was a perfect way to end this amazing Indian food meal in Bangkok.NOTE: This video is not sponsored, I arranged to eat here and film a video because I had heard great things about their tandoori food and their giant naan. However, after I asked for the bill, they insisted that I not pay for our meal. That being said prices range from about 400 - 600 THB per dish, with the lamb and lobster being about 1,500 THB each.üìç Charcoal Tandoor Grill: https://goo.gl/maps/GhH1b3Vz5ioSKZdu6üéµMUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîüçå100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5züëïGet t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîüì±FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

The lineup includes both emerging and established artists who will be performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time. This celebration highlights the beautiful cornucopia of Black music and our special way of presenting it. We hope you enjoy.Bobby Carter | February 25, 2021Kirk Franklin, set up with his band and choir in a corner of Uncle Jessie's Kitchen, makes a declaration. I know you're at home right now, in your draws, listening to some Jesus music. It's ok. Jesus loves you in your draws! The Arlington, Texas studio, named after a long time close friend, features a large photo of the iconic I AM A MAN protest signs from the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Strike on the wall. The jubilant energy that Franklin and company emit, juxtaposed with a visual reminder of the strife that Black people have endured is illustrative of the importance of gospel music in the Black community.For nearly 30 years, Franklin has been widely regarded for revolutionizing gospel. He incorporated secular music, particularly hip-hop, while preserving the message and integrity of traditional gospel. Here, he and his powerhouse choir pace through a decades-long, sixteen Grammy award winning discography of faith, praise and encouragement while cracking plenty of jokes. I cannot recall a more moving Tiny Desk home performance.All month long, we've presented artists that speak to the diversity and complexity of Black music--where we've been, where we are and where we're going. For the final show, we take it back to the spiritual roots and there's no one more fitting to cap things off than Mr. Kirk Franklin.SET LISTLove Theory Silver and GoldMelodies From Heaven I SmileMUSICIANSKirk Franklin: vocals, keysMelodie Pace: vocalsDarian Elliot: vocalsMichael Bethany: vocalsEboni Ellerson: vocalsDeon Yancey: vocalsTia Rudd: vocalsShaun Martin: keyboardMatthew Ramsey: bassTerry Baker: drums, percussionCREDITSVideo: Clear Scope MediaAudio: Michael Havens Reese BrooksTINY DESK TEAMProducers: Bobby CarterVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle SmithAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinArt Director: CJ RiculanTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia SternExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann"

The real footage in this video was captured by several cameras that are part of the rover's entry, descent, and landing suite. The views include a camera looking down from the spacecraft's descent stage (a kind of rocket-powered jet pack that helps fly the rover to its landing site), a camera on the rover looking up at the descent stage, a camera on the top of the aeroshell (a capsule protecting the rover) looking up at that parachute, and a camera on the bottom of the rover looking down at the Martian surface. The audio embedded in the video comes from the mission control call-outs during entry, descent, and landing.

The Navcams are on the remote sensing mast (or ‚Äúhead‚Äù) of the rover.  Perseverance possesses the most cameras of any Mars rover to date, with 19 on the rover. Perseverance landed on Mars‚Äô Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021. These images were obtained on February 20, 2021. A key objective for Perseverance‚Äôs mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet‚Äôs geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith.Please note: Not all browsers support viewing 360 videos.

A friendly football discussion of Cam deciding between Chad and Brandon on who the X would be in his ideal offense quickly turns up the heat to hard hitting questions on what went on this past season. Fred says Cam had the hardest job in the league following Tom Brady and relates to the tough position he was put in coming into the New England offense. Cam explains how he found the process of missing the offseason instrumental to getting in sync with his team and a lesson in why the little things are big things in the end. Brandon doesn't shy away from him talking about his up and down play during this past season while calling him out for it on air a few times. Tackling the rumors that Cam is done and seeking retirement-  Cam says he's never been the favorite and that fuels him but he quickly clears up that he is not going out like that and there aren't 32 guys better than he is!! Taking a trip down memory lane, Cam and Fred reminisce about meeting during Cam's early college football days in Florida and Cam telling the story of how Fred set the bar of professionalism and character that he desired to have in his career. The two reference their old friend and teammate Chico the late Aaron Hernandez which leads them into a tough discussion of disbelief and confusion with what really went on with him. Chef Jonathan Lowe fills in for Chef Nancie and makes a vegan meal for Cam which immediately draws critique from Chad on healthy eating habits who then volunteers that he should take over Cam's diet this offseason to get him eating right.   Cam exclusively opens up about his new hat line and in celebration of Black History Month a design tribute to honoring trail blazers starting with Rosa Parks. Keeping his business hat on, Cam tells the guys that his passion for cigars, art and live music led him to open Fellaship, an upscale premium dining experience in Atlanta. Applying what he has learned on the field as a leader into running a business, Cam shares why he loves being hands on with the details and the daily operation. Changing gears real fast- Brandon asks the guys about men's hygiene which leads into a wild conversation about manscaping and the things guys should and shouldn't do! 20% off + free shipping with the code: ATHLETE at manscaped.com. #Ad---------------------------WATCH MORE ‚Üí https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGAaZmvZaF9gtsK1erpReLEv_kiofqr4wFOLLOW US ON:Instagram | https://instagram.com/iamathletepodcastTwitter | https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpodWebsite | https://houseofathlete.com#IAMATHLETE#BrandonMarshall"

On the 20th of February 2021,  a United Boeing 777-200, registration N772UA performing flight UA-328 from Denver,CO to Honolulu,HI (USA) with 231 passengers and 10 crew, was in the initial climb out of Denver's runway 25 when the right hand engine's (PW4077) inlet separated associated with the failure of the engine. The crew declared Mayday reporting an engine failure. The aircraft stopped the climb at about 13000 feet, the crew requested to return to Denver after running the checklists. ATC offered any runway, they would make it happen. The aircraft returned to Denver for a safe landing on runway 26 about 23 minutes after departure. The aircraft stopped on the runway for a check by emergency services. Emergency services advised of an active fire within the right hand engine and extinguished the fire a few minutes later. The aircraft was subsequently towed off the runway to a remote parking stand, where passengers disembarked and were bussed to the terminal. There were no injuries.The engine inlet fell into the neighbourhood of Broomfield,CO, located about 16nm west of Denver near 13th and Elmwood Street, the debris also struck through the roof of an adjacent house.Broomfield police reported that although debris impacted the neighbourhood and damaged a number of homes, there were no injuries on the ground. The debris field expands over a nautical mile.Ground observers reported hearing the sound of an explosion like bang, smoke and saw the debris falling down. The aircraft continued flying.Watch the video to learn more about what happened! Thank you very much for your time! I hope you enjoy this video!Wishing you all the best!

The new Dave Mustaine Collection will span acoustic and electric guitars across Gibson, Epiphone, and Kramer.Dave will join the Gibson Artist Alliance -a forum which includes legendary musicians, innovative movers and shakers, and new talent - to share in thought leadership, research & development, mentorship of the next generation of players, as well as philanthropic endeavors. In addition to the Dave Mustaine Collection, Dave will be featured in original content and special projects across Gibson, Epiphone, and Kramer.‚ÄúOne of first albums I ever bought was Kiss Alive.¬†On the back of that LP was the Gibson logo, followed by ‚ÄòKiss uses Gibson Guitars because they want the best‚Äô. Period,‚Äù says Dave Mustaine. ‚ÄúYears later, I‚Äôm still that same fan, but now I‚Äôve been playing, touring, writing, and performing around the world myself, and I can say that I could not agree more with that statement. As I was looking for a change in my guitars, I met with Cesar and got his perspective on the vision and direction Gibson is taking. I saw passion, respect for the instruments, a focus on quality and a company that is led by guitar players. I feel I am finally at home with Gibson and I am proud of what we‚Äôre building together. I can‚Äôt wait for the world to get their hands on the new Gibson, Epiphone, and Kramer Dave Mustaine Collection guitars. This is a dream come true for me, don‚Äôt #@!# wake me up.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an honor to welcome icon, pioneer and visionary musician Dave Mustaine to the Gibson family as our brand ambassador‚Äù, said Cesar Gueikian of Gibson Brands. ‚ÄúDave is one of the most influential metal icons and riff lords of all time, having paved the way for multiple generations of players to carry the flag for hard rock and heavy metal, from riff writers to shredders and everyone in between. Working with Dave is especially gratifying because he is a guitar nerd like me, who gets involved in every aspect of the development of the concepts and ideas we have been designing with him at the Gibson Lab. When I was as kid learning how to play guitar, I aspired to play Dave‚Äôs riffs and I was one of the fortunate fans who attended their Youthanasia Tour concert at Estadio Obras Sanitarias in 1994, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where the ‚ÄòAguante Megadeth‚Äô chant was born over the song Symphony of Destruction. That was an epic night that I will never forget. I look forward to bringing this partnership to life and unveiling the first stages of the Dave Mustaine Collection to the world.‚Äù#gibson #davemustaine #megadethCONNECT WITH GIBSONhttps://www.gibson.com/https://www.facebook.com/Gibson/https://twitter.com/gibsonguitarhttps://www.instagram.com/gibsonguitar/ SHOP GIBSON BRANDShttps://www.gibson.com/https://www.epiphone.com/http://www.kramerguitars.com/http://www.steinberger.com/https://www.krksys.com/https://www.mesaboogie.com ABOUT GIBSON BRANDSGibson, the world‚Äôs most iconic guitar brand, has shaped the sounds of generations of musicians and music lovers across genres for more than 100 years.
