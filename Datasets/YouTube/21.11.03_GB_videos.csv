This video there are THREE hunters/hitmen instead of just one.This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to survive for 100 minutes, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo tries to prevent me from surviving. Every 10 minutes there is a 10 minute period of invincibility. They can see me through walls, and the world is small. It's a chase, a race, and it's super intense. A lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.If this video gets 1,500,000 likes we'll do it again!Manhunt T-Shirt Details:Each and every Manhunt t-shirt purchased will be assigned a unique number. Limit 10 Manhunt t-shirts per order.In late April after all shirts have been processed, we will randomly select one unique Manhunt t-shirt number for invitation into a 2021 Dream Manhunt video. Dream will announce the associated order number (and perhaps country and initials) via social media. The lucky customer does not need to see the announcement or know their order number, because we will make reasonable attempts to contact the customer using the contact information provided at checkout. Do not fall for scams that ask you to provide sensitive information or click, install or open anything! If contact attempts are not successful or the invitation is not accepted within 2 business days, we will repeat the same process every 2 business days approximately until an invitation is accepted. The non-transferable invitation and video participation have no retail or monetary value for the purchaser of the Manhunt t-shirt which is sold at fair value and is non-refundable. Adequate computer, internet, video and other capabilities will be arranged if necessary for the sole purpose of video participation.Employees and their families are not eligible for selection.Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that.

Impeccably clad in a black-and-white wrap dress, the Duchess of Sussex talked with her friend Oprah Winfrey about her life in and out of the palace. As promised, no subject was off-limits, including discussion about rumors that she had made Kate Middleton cry over an incident before her wedding. She discussed her feelings over learning that son Archie would not be named a prince and would not receive security, and ‚Äî perhaps most shockingly ‚Äî revealed that at her lowest point, she felt she didn't want to be alive anymore.  Meghan also denied being the leading player in the couple's decision to relinquish their senior royal status and pursue their own life and goals in the relative privacy of their new California home. Some royal watchers have long claimed that the duchess is claiming victimhood to cover up her own ambitions and agenda. Bustle reports that several of them weighed in on the Oprah interview even before it aired, claiming she was putting on a good show in front of a friend asking softball questions. The quotes were gathered by a pair of social experimenters curious to see whether the royal experts would comment on something they hadn't seen. So was Meghan's apparent vulnerability all an act? One expert offers some thoughts. The List spoke to Mark Bowden, a human behavior and body language expert who is also a panelist on The Behavior Panel. He watched Meghan's gestures and facial expressions, and what he found might come as a surprise to the palace loyalists. Bowden notes that the duchess seemed most open and expressive when she was talking about the wedding vows she and Harry exchanged three days before the big royal ceremony. He says, When remembering happy events, she is big and bold with her gestures. But her body language when talking about less pleasant matters was even more telling. Suppressing the lips or putting a hand to one's mouth can indicate you're trying not to say too much; Meghan did both when talking about her naivet√© about marrying royalty, and again when she talked about unnamed palace individuals who hadn't been supportive of her. As Meghan recalled feeling unprotected from the media, she lowered her head and covered her eyes; Bowden says this indicates she was feeling, Either shame she feels about not being protected, or shame about how she now feels towards the institution for not protecting her. She showed indications of stress, such as swallowing and rapid breathing, when discussing such uncomfortable topics as her suicidal thoughts and racism within the Firm. What about the account of her conflict with Kate? Meghan told Oprah that in fact, it was Kate who made her cry that day. Bowden says that Meghan's vocal tones and increased blinking indicate the story is true. Throughout the two-hour long special, the Duchess of Sussex displayed real emotions between the movement of her eyes, mouth and forehead. When she talked about the South Africa tour in which she infamously told a reporter that she was not okay, her facial expressions gave away her duress. Bowden notes that her, Blink rate [was] up on talking about tour of South Africa and the pain she was feeling. As things worsened within the family, Markle revealed, she discovered that her son would not receive the protection that she would have liked. During this segment of their conversation, Markle's forehead told the story of how painful that exchange was for her. Bowen even notes that her forehead movements showed, The grief around how she was told her son was not going to be protected. Once the discussion around her mental health struggles began, it was Markle's breathing that spoke volumes. Bowen adds, [Her] breathing rate [was] high as she recovered from telling the story of thinking about suicide. Viewers also watched as her eyes welled with tears and she explained how trapped and lonely she felt within her confines in the institution. Luckily, Markle's husband showed his support throughout the interview, with Bowen even noting their close touch. Meghan's thumb rubs Harry's hand in soothing gestures. The Duchess also had another ally in her interviewer. Bowen says, By the end of the interview Oprah and Megan are mirroring each other almost exactly. [...] Hand to face ‚Äî finger curled below lip. Very sympathetic to each other.#MeghanMarkle #Oprah #BodyLanguageRead Full Article: https://www.thelist.com/349898/what-a-body-language-expert-noticed-in-meghan-markles-oprah-interview/"

I am not in ANY way obligated to mention these products and if I have done so, it is because I genuinely like them. I would NEVER talk about or show something I didn't genuinely love.Sometimes, I may be sponsored by brands for videos. I turn down 90% of sponsorship opportunities. I will not accept unless I love the brand/product already. All products/items will still have been chosen by myself, and the video concept will always be my own idea. I would never endorse a brand/product that I didn't truly love and believe in.I use affiliate links in the description box of this channel. This means I earn a very small percentage when you purchase a product I recommend- the same way a sales associate in a store earns commission when they help you select a product. This does not in any way affect the price you pay for the item, and absolutely does not influence my choice of items to show you. Lots of love,Freds x"

While it's been lovely, we're very keen to get out of cold Europe, and we're hanging out for some stereotypical palm trees and cocktails Caribbean. Even though this is the 3rd sail across the Atlantic, everything about preparing for these trips wracks the nerves, making you prone to existential crises while staring at apples at the shops. We've got our flares and emergency fishing gear and about a dozen litres of curry, fingers crossed that'll be enough.Thanks once again to our viewers, supporters and Patreons, we love bringing you these big sails and this experience, and it's all powered by you (and some decently strong Atlantic trade winds).

I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

Um I really hope they held you down I really hope it was no lying 'Cause my heart breaks, it feels like the world's gone But if the love's real, you'd feel your soul roar like a lion And you'd finally let bygones be bygones Don't throw in the towel, I know it feels like you're the only one trying You just gotta learn to live and love on I belong with the one put on this Earth for me Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see I'm screaming out, Lord, help me, I've been lonely That's when you accept me, then you set me free Uh, sometimes life's a mess I get high when I'm upset I remember when me and love didn't click Searching for somethin' real then I found it Uh, sometimes life's a mess Yeah, I get high when I'm upset I remember when me and love ain't click Looking for somethin' real then I found it (Clever) Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody that made promises to give you the world? There‚Äôs one that won‚Äôt never leave you cold‚ÄØor place nothing above you.. that will love a heart that hurts- don‚Äôt hurt the heart that loves you. Sometimes they just want what they can‚Äôt have- forbidden fruit. But the one that deserves ya love will never pick and choose. There was once a hole in my heart- that hole was hurting-‚ÄØ til I took a peak inside- lately i‚Äôve been soul searching. When I use to cry I turned to medication- then I found me something real and forgot all the imitations. Just tell me that you‚Äôll never leave. And when there‚Äôs nothing left to say. Tell me that you‚Äôll love me anyway ahhh Uh, sometimes life's a mess I get high when I'm upset I remember when me and love didn't click Searching for somethin' real then I found it Uh, sometimes life's a mess Yeah, I get high when I'm upset I remember when me and love ain't click Looking for somethin' real then I found it (Post Malone) Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody‚ÄØ that made promises to give you the world?‚ÄØ And I swear I would never leave you cold There ain‚Äôt no one above you.‚ÄØ You were way too high to touch‚ÄØ I was high enough to pass out.‚ÄØ When you was so alone I was a stones throw away.‚ÄØ I remember those lips‚ÄØ I remember how they taste.‚ÄØ I been staring at the wall doing nothing all day.‚ÄØ I remember everything put the bottle to my face- Dom Pe.‚ÄØ If you gave up on me now I would seriously be so fucked up.‚ÄØ I‚Äôm doing everything I can just to keep myself from throwing up.‚ÄØ Never gave a fuck what they say bout us.‚ÄØ Fuck all of you muh fuckers slow me up.‚ÄØ and fuck everything that ruined us.‚ÄØ I‚Äôm three seconds away from pulling out my gun #JuiceWRLD #Clever #PostMalone"

Similar to the high-altitude flight tests of Starship SN8 and SN9, SN10 will be powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee ‚Äì approximately 10 km in altitude. SN10 will perform a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent.  The Starship prototype will descend under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship‚Äôs attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. SN10‚Äôs Raptor engines will then reignite as the vehicle attempts a landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down on the landing pad adjacent to the launch mount. A controlled aerodynamic descent with body flaps and vertical landing capability, combined with in-space refilling, are critical to landing Starship at destinations across the solar system where prepared surfaces or runways do not exist, and returning to Earth. This capability will enable a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.  Given the dynamic schedule of development testing, stay tuned to our social media channels for updates as we move toward SpaceX‚Äôs third high-altitude flight test of Starship!"
