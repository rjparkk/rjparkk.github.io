We build things like houses, fountains, boats and all sorts of stuff - and the mod I had made it sooo much better hahahaha. I had to be so careful because I didn't want Bad to catch on too fast to the trolling, but oh my gosh it was so funny. He really thought the server was lagging LMAO.

I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!PRE-ORDER THE LIMITED EDITION RUBIK'S CUBE:https://www.moriah-rubiks.com/_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 26 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL).

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Stephen Thompson | March 17, 2021If you were to apply one of those how it started / how it's going memes to Tiny Desk (home) concerts — which began, it turns out, almost exactly one year ago — you'd have, under how it's going, the image of pop superstar Justin Bieber as he and his band perform the world premiere of a new song called Peaches.Peaches will exist in a significantly different form when Bieber drops his new album Justice on Friday — the track will feature guest vocals from GIVEŌN and Daniel Caesar — just as Holy, another song from Justice, opens this set without the presence of guest Chance the Rapper. But Bieber's Tiny Desk set, performed with the aid of We the Band, provides the fullest taste yet (fully 25 percent!) of the singer's sixth album, whose singles have already been streamed hundreds of millions of times.Bieber has had a massive month as he prepares for Justice to drop: March 2021 began with the singer's 27th birthday and recently produced his second career Grammy, as he took the prize for best country duo or group performance for 10,000 Hours with Dan + Shay. It continues with this, his Tiny Desk debut. Friday, the next chapter officially begins.SET LISTHolyPeachesHold OnAnyoneMUSICIANSJustin Bieber: vocals, keysHarv: bassO'Neil Doctor O Palmer: keysDJ Tay James: DJRobert Taylor: drumsJulian McGuire: guitarCREDITSVideo: Nick Demoura, Mike Drew, Rory Kramer, Aaron Kroger, James CokerAudio: Jim Ebdon, Dylan Ely, James Roach, Chris Houghton, Taylor MeyerProduction Manager: Chris GrattonCamera Operators: Austin Wavra, Daniel Mardoyan, Noel GalanLighting Tech: Jim MecseryTINY DESK TEAMProducer: Bobby CarterVideo Producers: Maia Stern, Morgan Noelle SmithAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara FrameExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann#justinbieber #tinydesk #nprmusic #pop #rnb"

I had a little more issue trying to sync the clips together near the end but I managed somehow. Also, I want people to still know that I did use a bot to keep things well sync because I don't intend on hiding that fact since I wanted to make this video as a fun viewing experience while delivering people exposure of new skin mods out there. In addition, I did not cross dissolve transition since one viewer recommended not too since it ruins the flow and while looking at it I have to agree. Even though some character skins didn't get a chance to sing I still made sure to each one gets a different skin while also making them look good in terms of their respected fandom. Overall, another fun video to make and I hope to continue for a little while longer.Mods used in this video:Main Website for these mods comes from GameBananaGenderSwap Picohttps://gamebanana.com/skins/189906Pico 2000shttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/189086BIGGIE CHEESEhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/185500Naruto over Pico!https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188275Kevin from Ed, Edd n eddyhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/186471Hollow knight little ghost over picohttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187525Lyanide Over Picohttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/189193Dream Over Picohttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187992Phil from Riddle Schoolhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/184033Six Over Girlfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/189995Girl Boyfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187090Narancia (JJBA) as BF Modhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/189684Darnell as Boyfriend Modhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185937Scott Pilgrim joins the Funk' (Weeks 1 to 4)https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190882Playable Tankmen!https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185177Pico over GF 2https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190115Jenny from MLAATR over GF!https://gamebanana.com/skins/188614Playable Sans Undertalehttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185286Chara - From UNDERTALE/ DONTFORGEThttps://gamebanana.com/skins/186417Boy Girlfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187658Hornet from Hollow Knight as GF!https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188587Lucifer from HT over gfhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185819Trish Una (JJBA) as GF Modhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/188133DreamSMP Modhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188064Dream girl friendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187290Rapper GF + Nene!https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185273Isabelle BFhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/187686Yu Narukami Boyfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/185032P5 x FNF: Ann Takamaki as Girlfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184829Chiaki Nanami as Girlfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185407Nagito Komaeda over Pico!https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184963FNF Mono Little Nightmares 2https://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190163Hajime Hinata over Boyfriendhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/185626►Follow Me!Twitter: https://twitter.com/PrizMatex​​#FridayNightFunkin​’"

These include everything like the new battle pass, the new map changes and all the locations such as Colossal Crops, Boney Burbs, The Spire, Primal Pond, Guardian Of The Sea, Guardian Of The Bay, Guardian Of The Fields, Pond, Lake Woods, Mountain, small unnamed locations around the new map, as well as the new Tier 100 skin alongside all the new skins from the battle pass and Season 6. One cool new feature are the characters/animals that Epic implemented that include the Spire Guardian, Frog, Chicken, Boar, and Wolf. These characters allow you to purchase rifts, information on the next storm circle, and disguises from the characters with gold. The gold system from last season remains in Season 6. I also include all the weapons that are built around crafting with the new characters like mechanical rifle, mechanical shockwave and explosive bow, makeshift bow, makeshift shotgun, makeshift SMG, makeshift revolver, primal rifle, primal shotgun, primal pistol, primal submachine gun, meat, animal bones, mechanical parts, and makeshift parts. Some weapons that were vaulted include the tac shotgun, the lever action shotgun, the lever action rifle, the dragon breath shotgun, zero point crystals and abilities, suppressed smgs, it's ok because the pump shotgun is back tho. Everything I showed new in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 6 was in arena meaning stuff like the new animals as well as weapons will be in all modes. Oh and before I forget, I also show the new umbrella you can customize, all the new weapon wraps, skins, dances, emotes, sprays, music songs, v-bucks, banners, and everything you can possibly think of from the Battle Pass for Season 6. So, if you're looking for everything new in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 6 as well as all the new changes regarding weapons and features/mechanics, then this video is definitely for you. On top of that, this video will show you the new chapter 2 Season 6 map, the new locations, and everything new so you can have more fun and be more knowledgeable for the new season.

Onion rings are far better than apple rings, carrot rings, and also rings. Subscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlYhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcookinghttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookinhttp://yousuckatcooking.comBefore we get into the recipe, let's talk safety. A hot pot full of oil is super dangerous. You can deep fry safely but you have to know what you're doing. The first time I tried it, I was dipping my meat thermometer in the oil to keep track of the temperature. This was colossally stupid. You need a dedicated thermometer on your pot so you can watch constantly and so you won't drop it inside. Better yet, a dedicated deep fryer is really the way to go, and you can just read the instruction manual. Long story short, if your oil temperature gets out of control a fire can start, and you can't put it out with water, you either have to smother it or use a fire extinguisher. Also, the oil takes FOREVER to cool down, so many sure anyone in your house knows not to touch it when you're done using it. It also takes FOREVER to heat up so it's super tempting to turn up the temperature, which is a mistake (on my stovetop, 350 F was just below the number 4. Anyway, read this guide if you think you actually want to try deep frying, and then just order onion rings from the bar instead. Deep Fry Safety https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-deep-fry-safelyRecipe Slice some onions and make ringsRemove tapeYeah basically take any onion you like Add ¾ cup of flour and ¼ cup corn starch to a bowl Then add spices; cayenne, chilli powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, whatever. Let's say around a tablespoon total Add around a cup of soda water, more or less, depending on how buck wild you've gone with the spices. One description I read about the thickness is that it should be like thick paint. Heat 3 or so inches of peanut oil to 350 degrees F in a tall sturdy pot (not non stick)Preferably on your back burner so it won't get knocked. If your vessel has handles, make sure they are not sticking out I see a lot of people use their fingers to put things into the oil. I don't like this method because that's too close for comfort. The spider strainer, in my opinion, is the best way to go. The chance of dropping something in the oil is very minimal. If you're going to use tongs, grip tightly, and I don't recommend silicon tipped tongs because they are slippery. You REALLY DON'T WANT TO CAUSE AN OIIL SPLASH So use your spider strainer to lower an undoh ring into the oilAfter a minute or a minute and a half, flip it, then take it out after another minute. Just trust your eyes in terms of how cooked you want it I highly recommend setting a timer each time you put a batch in as it's easy to get distracted for one minute and you really have to have your head in the game for as long as you are deep frying Place onion rings on a wire rack with paper towels underneath. If you don't have a wire rack you can place them on paper towels on a plate or in a bowl When you're all done, move that oil to the back burner if it's not already there (very, very carefully, using oven mitts), and make sure everyone knows not to touch it for a couple hours. Keep your thermometer in there so you know when it's completely cooledThen you can either save it or dispose of it. Here's a helpful guide on how to dispose of the oil...long story short, it will end up in the trash, not the sink or toilet https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-do-i-dispose-of-used-cooking-oil-908995Thanks! I hope you order onion rings from the bar."

She befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together they are able to build a life for themselves on the London streets. One day, Estella’s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute, played by two-time Oscar® winner Emma Thompson (“Howards End,” “Sense & Sensibility”). But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.  Disney’s “Cruella” is directed by Craig Gillespie (“I Tonya”) from a screenplay by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara, story by Aline Brosh McKenna and Kelly Marcel & Steve Zissis. It was produced by Andrew Gunn (“Freaky Friday”), Marc Platt (“Mary Poppins Returns”) and Kristin Burr (“Christopher Robin”), with Emma Stone, Michelle Wright, Jared LeBoff and Glenn Close serving as executive producers. Two-time Oscar®- winning costume designer Jenny Beavan (“Mad Max: Fury Road,” “A Room with a View”) creates the dazzling and imaginative costumes, which take on a life of their own.For more information on “Cruella,” follow us on:Facebook:        https://www.facebook.com/DisneyCruellaDeVil Twitter:             https://twitter.com/cruella  Instagram:       https://www.instagram.com/disneycruella YouTube:         https://youtube.com/disneymovietrailers​Hashtag:          #Cruella"

We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. It was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎"

I try to survive for 100 minutes, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo tries to prevent me from surviving. Every 10 minutes there is a 10 minute period of invincibility. They can see me through walls, and the world is small. It's a chase, a race, and it's super intense. A lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.If this video gets 1,500,000 likes we'll do it again!Manhunt T-Shirt Details:Each and every Manhunt t-shirt purchased will be assigned a unique number. Limit 10 Manhunt t-shirts per order.In late April after all shirts have been processed, we will randomly select one unique Manhunt t-shirt number for invitation into a 2021 Dream Manhunt video. Dream will announce the associated order number (and perhaps country and initials) via social media. The lucky customer does not need to see the announcement or know their order number, because we will make reasonable attempts to contact the customer using the contact information provided at checkout. Do not fall for scams that ask you to provide sensitive information or click, install or open anything! If contact attempts are not successful or the invitation is not accepted within 2 business days, we will repeat the same process every 2 business days approximately until an invitation is accepted. The non-transferable invitation and video participation have no retail or monetary value for the purchaser of the Manhunt t-shirt which is sold at fair value and is non-refundable. Adequate computer, internet, video and other capabilities will be arranged if necessary for the sole purpose of video participation.Employees and their families are not eligible for selection.Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that.
