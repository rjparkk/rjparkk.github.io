The video footage garnered using various devices, including smartphones, was then sent to Anno and staff in Japan for finishing.Hope you enjoy this finished piece, it's a little bit bittersweet, and like revisiting intimate and precious memories from times past.[About “Evangelion: New Theatrical Edition”]TV anime series “Neon Genesis EVANGELION” was first broadcast in 1995, taking the world by storm.The “Evangelion: New Theatrical Edition” film series started in 2007 with EVANGELION: 1.0 YOU ARE (NOT) ALONE. followed by “EVANGELION: 2.0 YOU CAN (NOT) ADVANCE.” and “EVANGELION: 3.0 YOU CAN (NOT) REDO. “all becoming record hits at the box office.The TV anime and each of the feature films have since continued to garner new fans and are very lucky to be popular among various generations along the way, and the newest and feature film finale will release in theaters on March 8, 2021.- Movie trailer : https://youtu.be/d8mf0qDD3Qg- Check out the daily countdown to the new film release with the Official smartphone app EVA-EXTRAGet a special digital coupon to use at the EVANGELION STORE!https://www.eva-info.jp/eva-extra/- Evangelion series Official site : https://www.evangelion.co.jp/- Evangelion series Official Twitter account : @evangelion_co- Evangelion series Official Instagram : @evangelion.official"

While it's been lovely, we're very keen to get out of cold Europe, and we're hanging out for some stereotypical palm trees and cocktails Caribbean. Even though this is the 3rd sail across the Atlantic, everything about preparing for these trips wracks the nerves, making you prone to existential crises while staring at apples at the shops. We've got our flares and emergency fishing gear and about a dozen litres of curry, fingers crossed that'll be enough.Thanks once again to our viewers, supporters and Patreons, we love bringing you these big sails and this experience, and it's all powered by you (and some decently strong Atlantic trade winds).

Today, the government’s solution to a future tsunami is to build an even bigger and longer seawall to protect Japan’s coastal communities.Up to 14 metres high and 400 kilometres long, the new seawall is dividingcommunities, and some fear, placing them in greater danger.In this ARTE documentary, presented by former ABC Japan correspondent Mark Willacy, The Great Wall of Japan travels along the north-eastern coast of Japan’s main island to meet the fishermen and communities affected by one of the country’s biggest ever construction projects.Oyster farmer Atsushi Fujita has mixed feelings about the wall, saying it’s destroying his community’s livelihood and culture.“We're all very sad that our former lifestyle has gone and we can no longer see the ocean from our windows. It's really affecting us a lot.”In the village of Akahama, fisherman Hiromi Kawaguchi has galvanised locals against the building of a giant wall. While he lost his wife and mother to the 2011 tsunami, he has no faith a new seawall will protect locals in the event of another great wave.“In the last tsunami, the old wall was destroyed and its remains were left floating on the surface like cubes of tofu. Everything man-made is destined to be destroyed. It’s inevitable.”But others support the wall, including construction executive Kazunori Yamamoto, who believes the old seawall saved his family in 2011.“The breakwater earned us precious time, enabling a lot of people to escape. Without the breakwater, my whole family would have died.”Scientists are divided on the benefits. Some say the wall will slow a tsunami’s advance, allowing more time for people to escape. Others say it will do the opposite, providing a false sense of security, delaying departure and putting people in greater danger.Some believe the 13 billion US dollars spent on the wall’s construction could have been better used moving more communities to higher ground.As Japan commemorates the tsunami’s 10th anniversary, this is a moving and timely story from the region hardest hit by the 2011 disaster.About Foreign Correspondent: Foreign Correspondent is the prime-time international public affairs program on Australia's national broadcaster, ABC-TV.

Afterward, I hauled the felled timber to my sawmill, where my dad and I processed it into cladding for the log cabin.The Pop-Up Cabin plans (PDF file) can be purchased on Teespring:https://teespring.com/en-GB/pop-up-cabin-plans-pdf     The comprehensive plans include: step-by-step instructions, cut list, and diagrams, which show exactly how the cabin was assembled from the ground up. Upon purchase, you will receive a unique link that you can use to download the plans in electronic form.Links to the Outsider Flashlight Collection (Affiliate Links):Outsider Collection: https://thrunite.com/the-outsider-collectionAmazon USA: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QYW72CD?ref=myi_title_dp Amazon Canada: http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08QYRVBCV?ref=myi_title_dp  Amazon Japan: http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B08R3VHLMW?ref=myi_title_dp  Amazon Germany: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08QZ5XRGV Get an Outsider Keychain Light (Ti2) for just the cost of shipping ($5.95) THRUNITE Website: https://thrunite.com/shipping-for-free-ti2-green/    On Amazon-USA: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N4198Y1 Canada: http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08JLTGBGC?ref=myi_title_dp UK: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08MZ9G22Z Japan: http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B08MZDQT9VOutsider Merch: https://teespring.com/stores/the-outsiderEquipment I use (Affiliate Links):Dewalt Cordless Circular Saw- https://amzn.to/3kIPzhUDewalt Cordless Drill Kit- https://amzn.to/35sdP0oTrail Cam- https://amzn.to/2Q6MD0BFiskars Axe- https://amzn.to/2EJVdhRChainsaw (Poulan)- https://amzn.to/2IP1flsChainsaw (Echo)- https://amzn.to/2VykyB2Pocket Knife- https://amzn.to/2Udm1MJFixed Blade Knife- https://amzn.to/2HnrT2iDrone- https://amzn.to/2IPucxHGoPro- https://amzn.to/2XDHReeCamcorder- https://amzn.to/2HnpLHqHeadlamp: https://amzn.to/2CyEe0uFlexible Tripod- https://amzn.to/2EIlRrj#theoutsider #logcabin #snowcat"

Many went without power or water, in subzero temperatures, for nearly five days. It was a disaster; dozens died. But even though that storm hit much of the country, the power outages were mostly limited to Texas. That’s because Texas is on its own electrical grid, separate from the rest of the country, which means it can’t easily get power from other states in an emergency.But Texas's grid itself is not what failed. Power went out across Texas in the first place because energy sources across the state were unprepared for severe weather. And that didn’t have to happen; Texas had been warned about this exact scenario, and had actually experienced versions of it twice in the last 30 years. But they didn’t prepare.Now the rest of the US faces the same issue. Climate change is making severe weather disasters more and more frequent. And the American energy system is not ready for it.Read more about what happened in Texas and about the US electrical grid: https://www.vox.com/22289517/texas-storm-uri-weather-power-outage-snowAnd check out more coverage of the Texas power crisis from the Texas Tribune: https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/22/texas-power-grid-extreme-weather/Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Similar to the high-altitude flight tests of Starship SN8 and SN9, SN10 will be powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 km in altitude. SN10 will perform a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent.  The Starship prototype will descend under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. SN10’s Raptor engines will then reignite as the vehicle attempts a landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down on the landing pad adjacent to the launch mount. A controlled aerodynamic descent with body flaps and vertical landing capability, combined with in-space refilling, are critical to landing Starship at destinations across the solar system where prepared surfaces or runways do not exist, and returning to Earth. This capability will enable a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.  Given the dynamic schedule of development testing, stay tuned to our social media channels for updates as we move toward SpaceX’s third high-altitude flight test of Starship!"

The outbreak has only exacerbated the challenges at malls as social distancing has placed restrictions on stores, movie theaters and restaurants. So what will become of malls in America after the pandemic ends?Shopping malls across the U.S. have been reeling as restaurant and retail tenants struggle to keep their doors open.Data compiled by Coresight Research shows about a quarter of U.S. malls could close over the next three to five years, accelerating a trend that began before the pandemic.Simon Property Group — the nation's biggest mall owner — said earlier this month that its fourth-quarter revenue dropped by 24% on a year-over-year basis to $1.1 billion.However, some analysts think Simon — with its portfolio of A-rated malls and a healthy balance sheet — will benefit as distressed malls operated by its rivals close their doors. The company is also expected to see gains from new additions like hotels and luxury residences.Unfortunately there are a lot of centers that don't fit that high profile and that have lost their competitive edge, said Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Goldfarb. The thing about Simon is they've been really focused on maintaining it, and that's both been through a combination of culling the lower productive centers as well as making sure that they keep investing in their top centers.Simon Property Group CEO David Simon said the company is also getting a lift from increasing traffic at some of its locations and from tenants paying their rent on time.Malls are a big tax driver for the communities they serve and employ lots of people locally. Watch the video above to find out more about the struggles U.S. malls face and what could become of them after the pandemic ends.» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

We've been selling Peak Design products on Amazon for years, and we work closely with Amazon to remove counterfeit and copycat products from their marketplace. Hence, we were astonished when we found out Amazon had copied one of our bestselling bags. They call it the Everyday Sling, which, funny enough, is exactly what we call our product.Amazon is a revolutionary service that we use and benefit from heavily. Also, Peak Design is not the first brand to see their products copied by an Amazon in-house brand. If we were really serious people, we might get on our soapbox and pontificate about the pitfalls of capitalism. But we're not really serious people. So we got some googley-eye glasses (thanks Amazon Prime!) and made this video instead.It's our goal to make the best things. If we tried to make the cheapest things, we wouldn't be us. Amazon reminded us of that. We appreciate the pep talk, Amazon.Know what we really appreciate? Our customers. Thank you for supporting intense, obsessive design that focuses on novel solutions to real problems. Thank you for supporting design practices that account for a product's lifecycle, and it's external impact on people and the planet.And if you want to know why Amazon just couldn't resist copying the Peak Design Everyday Sling, check it out for yourself: https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/everyday-bags/products/everyday-sling?variant=29742302068780"

When Kelly joins forces with fellow SEAL Karen Greer and shadowy CIA agent Robert Ritter, the mission unwittingly exposes a covert plot that threatens to engulf the U.S. and Russia in an all-out war.FB: www.facebook.com/WithoutRemorseMovieTW: www.twitter.com/WithoutRemorseIG: www.instagram.com/WithoutRemorseMovieAbout Prime Video:Want to watch it now?

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Bobby Carter | March 3, 2021Jack Harlow's Tiny Desk (home) concert feels like the arrival of a rap superstar. Tucked in a homey-looking space in Los Angeles surrounded by bookshelves and vintage furniture, the Louisville, Ky., emcee delivers a performance with the confidence of an old pro. His set, however, is the first time he's relied solely on live instrumentation to bring his songs to life. It's been a long time since I had a chance to perform and I've never done it like this, he says.This is a far stretch from the kid with loose curls and specs frolicing with his hometown friends, but his success should serve as a reminder of the importance of artist development. He's been able to slow cook for a few years, consistently dropping mixtapes and visuals until he landed a big hit last year in WHATS POPPIN. That performance earned him a Grammy nomination ahead of his very impressive debut album, Thats What They All Say.For this turn at the Tiny Desk, Harlow, his band and some background singers deliver a megamix of highlights from the album. The orchestration underscores his sentimental and introspective side on songs like Same Guy and Funny Seeing You Here, but it also elevates the melody, which is the true hero here. Over the past few years, the 22-year-old rapper has steadily ticked the boxes for a successful career, and this showing undoubtedly checks the performer section.SET LISTRendezvous21C / DeltaFunny Seeing You HereSame GuyCreme/ONCE MAY COMESWhats PoppinMUSICIANSJack Harlow: vocalsO'Neil Doctor O Palmer: keysRico Nichols: drumsJoe Cleveland - bassRob Gueringer: guitarErik B: vocalsChimera Patrice: vocalsPorcha Clay: vocalsCREDITSVideo: Ace Pro, Chadrick Fellers / WastedPotential, Donald Turner, Karis West, Kylie HazzardAudio: Nickie Jon Pabón, CJ BlairPlayback: Kenny WoodsBackline: Jonathan CastilloTINY DESK TEAMProducer: Bobby CarterVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle SmithAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia SternExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann#jackharlow #tinydesk #hiphop #nprmusic"

Pop music sensation Nick Jonas reclaims his red chair alongside superstar returning coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend, and Blake Shelton for Season 20. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named “The Voice” and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.

It shares its platform and tech with the Porsche, but Audi is pitching it as more of a cruiser than an outright sports car... just one that happens to have supercar-shaming performance. With up to 637bhp available, it's not just the first Audi RS model to be pure electric, it's also the most powerful to ever wear the RS badge. Top Gear Magazine editor Jack Rix, is among the first to drive one and deliver his verdict. As a bonus, we also speak to tech-reviewer Marques Brownlee about his thoughts on Audi's new offering, and EVs in general. Marques is one of YouTube's top tech-experts and, as we reveal in the film, soon to be a new regular contributor to Top Gear Magazine with monthly written reviews on new electrified cars.
