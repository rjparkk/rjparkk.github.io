This video there are THREE hunters/hitmen instead of just one.This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to survive for 100 minutes, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo tries to prevent me from surviving. Every 10 minutes there is a 10 minute period of invincibility. They can see me through walls, and the world is small. It's a chase, a race, and it's super intense. A lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.If this video gets 1,500,000 likes we'll do it again!Manhunt T-Shirt Details:Each and every Manhunt t-shirt purchased will be assigned a unique number. Limit 10 Manhunt t-shirts per order.In late April after all shirts have been processed, we will randomly select one unique Manhunt t-shirt number for invitation into a 2021 Dream Manhunt video. Dream will announce the associated order number (and perhaps country and initials) via social media. The lucky customer does not need to see the announcement or know their order number, because we will make reasonable attempts to contact the customer using the contact information provided at checkout. Do not fall for scams that ask you to provide sensitive information or click, install or open anything! If contact attempts are not successful or the invitation is not accepted within 2 business days, we will repeat the same process every 2 business days approximately until an invitation is accepted. The non-transferable invitation and video participation have no retail or monetary value for the purchaser of the Manhunt t-shirt which is sold at fair value and is non-refundable. Adequate computer, internet, video and other capabilities will be arranged if necessary for the sole purpose of video participation.Employees and their families are not eligible for selection.Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed runner / survivalist in Minecraft against a killer / assassin / hitmen#MinecraftHitmen"

While it's been lovely, we're very keen to get out of cold Europe, and we're hanging out for some stereotypical palm trees and cocktails Caribbean. Even though this is the 3rd sail across the Atlantic, everything about preparing for these trips wracks the nerves, making you prone to existential crises while staring at apples at the shops. We've got our flares and emergency fishing gear and about a dozen litres of curry, fingers crossed that'll be enough.Thanks once again to our viewers, supporters and Patreons, we love bringing you these big sails and this experience, and it's all powered by you (and some decently strong Atlantic trade winds).

The video footage garnered using various devices, including smartphones, was then sent to Anno and staff in Japan for finishing.Hope you enjoy this finished piece, it's a little bit bittersweet, and like revisiting intimate and precious memories from times past.[About “Evangelion: New Theatrical Edition”]TV anime series “Neon Genesis EVANGELION” was first broadcast in 1995, taking the world by storm.The “Evangelion: New Theatrical Edition” film series started in 2007 with EVANGELION: 1.0 YOU ARE (NOT) ALONE. followed by “EVANGELION: 2.0 YOU CAN (NOT) ADVANCE.” and “EVANGELION: 3.0 YOU CAN (NOT) REDO. “all becoming record hits at the box office.The TV anime and each of the feature films have since continued to garner new fans and are very lucky to be popular among various generations along the way, and the newest and feature film finale will release in theaters on March 8, 2021.- Movie trailer : https://youtu.be/d8mf0qDD3Qg- Check out the daily countdown to the new film release with the Official smartphone app EVA-EXTRAGet a special digital coupon to use at the EVANGELION STORE!https://www.eva-info.jp/eva-extra/- Evangelion series Official site : https://www.evangelion.co.jp/- Evangelion series Official Twitter account : @evangelion_co- Evangelion series Official Instagram : @evangelion.official"

Today, the government’s solution to a future tsunami is to build an even bigger and longer seawall to protect Japan’s coastal communities.Up to 14 metres high and 400 kilometres long, the new seawall is dividingcommunities, and some fear, placing them in greater danger.In this ARTE documentary, presented by former ABC Japan correspondent Mark Willacy, The Great Wall of Japan travels along the north-eastern coast of Japan’s main island to meet the fishermen and communities affected by one of the country’s biggest ever construction projects.Oyster farmer Atsushi Fujita has mixed feelings about the wall, saying it’s destroying his community’s livelihood and culture.“We're all very sad that our former lifestyle has gone and we can no longer see the ocean from our windows. It's really affecting us a lot.”In the village of Akahama, fisherman Hiromi Kawaguchi has galvanised locals against the building of a giant wall. While he lost his wife and mother to the 2011 tsunami, he has no faith a new seawall will protect locals in the event of another great wave.“In the last tsunami, the old wall was destroyed and its remains were left floating on the surface like cubes of tofu. Everything man-made is destined to be destroyed. It’s inevitable.”But others support the wall, including construction executive Kazunori Yamamoto, who believes the old seawall saved his family in 2011.“The breakwater earned us precious time, enabling a lot of people to escape. Without the breakwater, my whole family would have died.”Scientists are divided on the benefits. Some say the wall will slow a tsunami’s advance, allowing more time for people to escape. Others say it will do the opposite, providing a false sense of security, delaying departure and putting people in greater danger.Some believe the 13 billion US dollars spent on the wall’s construction could have been better used moving more communities to higher ground.As Japan commemorates the tsunami’s 10th anniversary, this is a moving and timely story from the region hardest hit by the 2011 disaster.About Foreign Correspondent: Foreign Correspondent is the prime-time international public affairs program on Australia's national broadcaster, ABC-TV.

I spent the night at the Pop-Up Cabin. From there, I headed deeper into the cedar forest to do some selective logging. That's when I ran into a problem... Afterward, I hauled the felled timber to my sawmill, where my dad and I processed it into cladding for the log cabin.The Pop-Up Cabin plans (PDF file) can be purchased on Teespring:https://teespring.com/en-GB/pop-up-cabin-plans-pdf     The comprehensive plans include: step-by-step instructions, cut list, and diagrams, which show exactly how the cabin was assembled from the ground up.

Many went without power or water, in subzero temperatures, for nearly five days. It was a disaster; dozens died. But even though that storm hit much of the country, the power outages were mostly limited to Texas. That’s because Texas is on its own electrical grid, separate from the rest of the country, which means it can’t easily get power from other states in an emergency.But Texas's grid itself is not what failed. Power went out across Texas in the first place because energy sources across the state were unprepared for severe weather. And that didn’t have to happen; Texas had been warned about this exact scenario, and had actually experienced versions of it twice in the last 30 years. But they didn’t prepare.Now the rest of the US faces the same issue. Climate change is making severe weather disasters more and more frequent. And the American energy system is not ready for it.Read more about what happened in Texas and about the US electrical grid: https://www.vox.com/22289517/texas-storm-uri-weather-power-outage-snowAnd check out more coverage of the Texas power crisis from the Texas Tribune: https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/22/texas-power-grid-extreme-weather/Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The outbreak has only exacerbated the challenges at malls as social distancing has placed restrictions on stores, movie theaters and restaurants. So what will become of malls in America after the pandemic ends?Shopping malls across the U.S. have been reeling as restaurant and retail tenants struggle to keep their doors open.Data compiled by Coresight Research shows about a quarter of U.S. malls could close over the next three to five years, accelerating a trend that began before the pandemic.Simon Property Group — the nation's biggest mall owner — said earlier this month that its fourth-quarter revenue dropped by 24% on a year-over-year basis to $1.1 billion.However, some analysts think Simon — with its portfolio of A-rated malls and a healthy balance sheet — will benefit as distressed malls operated by its rivals close their doors. The company is also expected to see gains from new additions like hotels and luxury residences.Unfortunately there are a lot of centers that don't fit that high profile and that have lost their competitive edge, said Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Goldfarb. The thing about Simon is they've been really focused on maintaining it, and that's both been through a combination of culling the lower productive centers as well as making sure that they keep investing in their top centers.Simon Property Group CEO David Simon said the company is also getting a lift from increasing traffic at some of its locations and from tenants paying their rent on time.Malls are a big tax driver for the communities they serve and employ lots of people locally. Watch the video above to find out more about the struggles U.S. malls face and what could become of them after the pandemic ends.» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

Similar to the high-altitude flight tests of Starship SN8 and SN9, SN10 will be powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 km in altitude. SN10 will perform a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent.  The Starship prototype will descend under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. SN10’s Raptor engines will then reignite as the vehicle attempts a landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down on the landing pad adjacent to the launch mount. A controlled aerodynamic descent with body flaps and vertical landing capability, combined with in-space refilling, are critical to landing Starship at destinations across the solar system where prepared surfaces or runways do not exist, and returning to Earth. This capability will enable a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.  Given the dynamic schedule of development testing, stay tuned to our social media channels for updates as we move toward SpaceX’s third high-altitude flight test of Starship!"
