When the 1 minute timer ends, I have to stop whatever I'm doing to put on the t-shirt, even if I'm in a dangerous situation! This made the game way harder but it was still really fun!After recording the video, all of the t-shirts were washed and donated to good causes.Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin"

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Stephen Thompson | March 17, 2021If you were to apply one of those how it started / how it's going memes to Tiny Desk (home) concerts — which began, it turns out, almost exactly one year ago — you'd have, under how it's going, the image of pop superstar Justin Bieber as he and his band perform the world premiere of a new song called Peaches.Peaches will exist in a significantly different form when Bieber drops his new album Justice on Friday — the track will feature guest vocals from GIVEŌN and Daniel Caesar — just as Holy, another song from Justice, opens this set without the presence of guest Chance the Rapper. But Bieber's Tiny Desk set, performed with the aid of We the Band, provides the fullest taste yet (fully 25 percent!) of the singer's sixth album, whose singles have already been streamed hundreds of millions of times.Bieber has had a massive month as he prepares for Justice to drop: March 2021 began with the singer's 27th birthday and recently produced his second career Grammy, as he took the prize for best country duo or group performance for 10,000 Hours with Dan + Shay. It continues with this, his Tiny Desk debut. Friday, the next chapter officially begins.SET LISTHolyPeachesHold OnAnyoneMUSICIANSJustin Bieber: vocals, keysHarv: bassO'Neil Doctor O Palmer: keysDJ Tay James: DJRobert Taylor: drumsJulian McGuire: guitarCREDITSVideo: Nick Demoura, Mike Drew, Rory Kramer, Aaron Kroger, James CokerAudio: Jim Ebdon, Dylan Ely, James Roach, Chris Houghton, Taylor MeyerProduction Manager: Chris GrattonCamera Operators: Austin Wavra, Daniel Mardoyan, Noel GalanLighting Tech: Jim MecseryTINY DESK TEAMProducer: Bobby CarterVideo Producers: Maia Stern, Morgan Noelle SmithAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara FrameExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann#justinbieber #tinydesk #nprmusic #pop #rnb"

These include everything like the new battle pass, the new map changes and all the locations such as Colossal Crops, Boney Burbs, The Spire, Primal Pond, Guardian Of The Sea, Guardian Of The Bay, Guardian Of The Fields, Pond, Lake Woods, Mountain, small unnamed locations around the new map, as well as the new Tier 100 skin alongside all the new skins from the battle pass and Season 6. One cool new feature are the characters/animals that Epic implemented that include the Spire Guardian, Frog, Chicken, Boar, and Wolf. These characters allow you to purchase rifts, information on the next storm circle, and disguises from the characters with gold. The gold system from last season remains in Season 6. I also include all the weapons that are built around crafting with the new characters like mechanical rifle, mechanical shockwave and explosive bow, makeshift bow, makeshift shotgun, makeshift SMG, makeshift revolver, primal rifle, primal shotgun, primal pistol, primal submachine gun, meat, animal bones, mechanical parts, and makeshift parts. Some weapons that were vaulted include the tac shotgun, the lever action shotgun, the lever action rifle, the dragon breath shotgun, zero point crystals and abilities, suppressed smgs, it's ok because the pump shotgun is back tho. Everything I showed new in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 6 was in arena meaning stuff like the new animals as well as weapons will be in all modes. Oh and before I forget, I also show the new umbrella you can customize, all the new weapon wraps, skins, dances, emotes, sprays, music songs, v-bucks, banners, and everything you can possibly think of from the Battle Pass for Season 6. So, if you're looking for everything new in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 6 as well as all the new changes regarding weapons and features/mechanics, then this video is definitely for you. On top of that, this video will show you the new chapter 2 Season 6 map, the new locations, and everything new so you can have more fun and be more knowledgeable for the new season.

Onion rings are far better than apple rings, carrot rings, and also rings. Subscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlYhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcookinghttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookinhttp://yousuckatcooking.comBefore we get into the recipe, let's talk safety. A hot pot full of oil is super dangerous. You can deep fry safely but you have to know what you're doing. The first time I tried it, I was dipping my meat thermometer in the oil to keep track of the temperature. This was colossally stupid. You need a dedicated thermometer on your pot so you can watch constantly and so you won't drop it inside. Better yet, a dedicated deep fryer is really the way to go, and you can just read the instruction manual. Long story short, if your oil temperature gets out of control a fire can start, and you can't put it out with water, you either have to smother it or use a fire extinguisher. Also, the oil takes FOREVER to cool down, so many sure anyone in your house knows not to touch it when you're done using it. It also takes FOREVER to heat up so it's super tempting to turn up the temperature, which is a mistake (on my stovetop, 350 F was just below the number 4. Anyway, read this guide if you think you actually want to try deep frying, and then just order onion rings from the bar instead. Deep Fry Safety https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-deep-fry-safelyRecipe Slice some onions and make ringsRemove tapeYeah basically take any onion you like Add ¾ cup of flour and ¼ cup corn starch to a bowl Then add spices; cayenne, chilli powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, whatever. Let's say around a tablespoon total Add around a cup of soda water, more or less, depending on how buck wild you've gone with the spices. One description I read about the thickness is that it should be like thick paint. Heat 3 or so inches of peanut oil to 350 degrees F in a tall sturdy pot (not non stick)Preferably on your back burner so it won't get knocked. If your vessel has handles, make sure they are not sticking out I see a lot of people use their fingers to put things into the oil. I don't like this method because that's too close for comfort. The spider strainer, in my opinion, is the best way to go. The chance of dropping something in the oil is very minimal. If you're going to use tongs, grip tightly, and I don't recommend silicon tipped tongs because they are slippery. You REALLY DON'T WANT TO CAUSE AN OIIL SPLASH So use your spider strainer to lower an undoh ring into the oilAfter a minute or a minute and a half, flip it, then take it out after another minute. Just trust your eyes in terms of how cooked you want it I highly recommend setting a timer each time you put a batch in as it's easy to get distracted for one minute and you really have to have your head in the game for as long as you are deep frying Place onion rings on a wire rack with paper towels underneath. If you don't have a wire rack you can place them on paper towels on a plate or in a bowl When you're all done, move that oil to the back burner if it's not already there (very, very carefully, using oven mitts), and make sure everyone knows not to touch it for a couple hours. Keep your thermometer in there so you know when it's completely cooledThen you can either save it or dispose of it. Here's a helpful guide on how to dispose of the oil...long story short, it will end up in the trash, not the sink or toilet https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-do-i-dispose-of-used-cooking-oil-908995Thanks! I hope you order onion rings from the bar."

The task proves more difficult than Bruce imagined, as each of the recruits must face the demons of their own pasts to transcend that which has held them back, allowing them to come together, finally forming an unprecedented league of heroes. Now united, Batman (Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), and The Flash (Ezra Miller) may be too late to save the planet from Steppenwolf, DeSaad, and Darkseid and their dreadful intentions.Subscribe: http://bit.ly/HBOMaxYouTubeBe the first to know more:HBO Max: https://hbom.ax/YTLike HBO Max on Facebook: http://bit.ly/HBOMaxFacebookFollow HBO Max on Twitter: http://bit.ly/HBOMaxTwitterFollow HBO Max on Instagram: http://bit.ly/HBOMaxInstagramAbout HBO Max: HBO Max is WarnerMedia’s direct-to-consumer offering with 10,000 hours of curated premium content.

She befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together they are able to build a life for themselves on the London streets. One day, Estella’s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute, played by two-time Oscar® winner Emma Thompson (“Howards End,” “Sense & Sensibility”). But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.  Disney’s “Cruella” is directed by Craig Gillespie (“I Tonya”) from a screenplay by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara, story by Aline Brosh McKenna and Kelly Marcel & Steve Zissis. It was produced by Andrew Gunn (“Freaky Friday”), Marc Platt (“Mary Poppins Returns”) and Kristin Burr (“Christopher Robin”), with Emma Stone, Michelle Wright, Jared LeBoff and Glenn Close serving as executive producers. Two-time Oscar®- winning costume designer Jenny Beavan (“Mad Max: Fury Road,” “A Room with a View”) creates the dazzling and imaginative costumes, which take on a life of their own.For more information on “Cruella,” follow us on:Facebook:        https://www.facebook.com/DisneyCruellaDeVil Twitter:             https://twitter.com/cruella  Instagram:       https://www.instagram.com/disneycruella YouTube:         https://youtube.com/disneymovietrailers​Hashtag:          #Cruella"

Important to note holding by the muzzle is common practice for a groomer while trimming the face and head. I am not applying any pressure, or causing him any pain. Most dogs will give me warning signals before attempting to bite. In this situation I had no warning, and that's what makes this so unexpected, especially coming from a Golden Retriever. The dog has also been groomed elsewhere, so it is possible a groomer may have held him too tightly by the muzzle and he remembered that.The owner was informed and sent home with homework to get the dog comfortable about having his face touched. We must touch the muzzle in order to wash and towel it dry, so the dog needs to be compliant for that."

Hugo Lloris was well beaten in the visitors' goal, but the ball bounced away to safety.Smith Rowe was the architect of our next chance, cutting the ball back from the byline to the lurking Alexandre Lacazette, but the Frenchman screwed his shot wide from six yards after attempting to open up his body and shoot across goal.But our dominance began to fade and we were punished on the half hour. Lamela - an early replacement for Heung-Min Son - showed great technique to score inside the far post.The goal was very much against the run of play, but we kept pushing and hit the woodwork for a second time when Cedric latched onto a loose ball just inside the box and crashed his effort against the upright.We deserved to be on terms, and finally drew level late in the half through Odegaard. Kieran Tierney got away down the left, sent in a low cross which the Norwegian steered beyond Lloris via a deflection off Toby Alderweireld.It was his second goal in four days after opening his account in Greece on Thursday.It would have been an injustice to go in behind at the interval, and we continued to dictate the play early in the second half.Nicolas Pepe was introduced for Bukayo Saka at the break, and the Ivorian's wonderful pass to Lacazette inside the box resulted in a penalty. Lacazette failed to make good contact with his shot, but was cleaned out by Davinson Sanchez. Referee Michael Oliver pointed to the spot and Lacazette himself dispatched.Lamela saw red for an elbow on Tierney, but perversely the visitors improved after going down to ten men.Harry Kane headed home a free-kick but was flagged offside as Spurs piled on the late pressure.Kane then struck the post from a free-kick and Gabriel made a superb clearing header to keep out Sanchez's follow up strike.It was nervy, but we held on for a thoroughly deserved victory.#arsenal #arsenalhighlights #premierleague Enjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, David Luiz, Vivianne Miedema, Nicolas Pepe, Alexandre Lacazette, Leah Williamson, Bernd Leno, Danielle van de Donk, Willian, Hector Bellerin, Jordan Nobbs, Bukayo Saka, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Thomas Partey and more.Subscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtubeFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebookFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitterFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagramFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktokThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.For more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

It's back and it's better than ever. Today we get to see what happens when we put two cocky players on one team and match them up against ANOTHER set of cocky players. So this means for example that Diamonds who think they deserve Champion, will go up against Champions who think they deserve Grand Champ. It's pretty epic and if the lower ranked players end up winning... well that would be the ultimate shameful moment for the higher ranked team. Rocket league is all about those sweet shiny ranks, but sometimes the players can get a little too attached to what they mean and obsess over the fact that they are better than what the game deems them. Let's find out if anyone can righteously claim a better rank through the ultimate test of pride.

We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. It was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎"

At the intersection of it all is the likeable, magnetic bodega owner Usnavi (Anthony Ramos), who saves every penny from his daily grind as he hopes, imagines and sings about a better life.“In the Heights” fuses Lin-Manuel Miranda’s kinetic music and lyrics with director Jon M. Chu’s lively and authentic eye for storytelling to capture a world very much of its place, but universal in its experience.“In the Heights” stars Anthony Ramos (“A Star is Born,” Broadway’s “Hamilton”), Corey Hawkins (“Straight Outta Compton,” “BlacKkKlansman”), singer/songwriter Leslie Grace, Melissa Barrera (TV’s “Vida”), Olga Merediz (Broadway’s “In the Heights”), Daphne Rubin-Vega (Broadway’s “Rent”), Gregory Diaz IV (Broadway’s “Matilda the Musical”), Stephanie Beatriz (TV’s “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”), Dascha Polanco (TV’s “Orange is the New Black”) and Jimmy Smits (the “Star Wars” films).Chu directed the film from a screenplay by Quiara Alegría Hudes, based on the musical stage play, music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda, book by Quiara Alegría Hudes and concept by Miranda. Miranda, Hudes, Scott Sanders, Anthony Bregman and Mara Jacobs produced the film, with David Nicksay and Kevin McCormick serving as executive producers.Behind the camera, Chu reunited with his “Crazy Rich Asians” production designer, Nelson Coates, and editor, Myron Kerstein.

This video there are THREE hunters/hitmen instead of just one.This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to survive for 100 minutes, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo tries to prevent me from surviving. Every 10 minutes there is a 10 minute period of invincibility. They can see me through walls, and the world is small. It's a chase, a race, and it's super intense. A lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.If this video gets 1,500,000 likes we'll do it again!Manhunt T-Shirt Details:Each and every Manhunt t-shirt purchased will be assigned a unique number. Limit 10 Manhunt t-shirts per order.In late April after all shirts have been processed, we will randomly select one unique Manhunt t-shirt number for invitation into a 2021 Dream Manhunt video. Dream will announce the associated order number (and perhaps country and initials) via social media. The lucky customer does not need to see the announcement or know their order number, because we will make reasonable attempts to contact the customer using the contact information provided at checkout. Do not fall for scams that ask you to provide sensitive information or click, install or open anything! If contact attempts are not successful or the invitation is not accepted within 2 business days, we will repeat the same process every 2 business days approximately until an invitation is accepted. The non-transferable invitation and video participation have no retail or monetary value for the purchaser of the Manhunt t-shirt which is sold at fair value and is non-refundable. Adequate computer, internet, video and other capabilities will be arranged if necessary for the sole purpose of video participation.Employees and their families are not eligible for selection.Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that.

I am forever grateful for this incredible opportunity and thankful to RuPaul for changing my life, but giving me the platform to showcase the art I've always wanted to create. To my sisters- I am so honored to be part of such a legendary cast. Our resilience will go down in history considering the factors held against us and I will fight for you to the end. I love you all so much. On that note- any energy or feelings you have towards my elimination should be directed towards LOVE and celebration. To my city- I hope I've made you proud. You've inspired me beyond measure and helped me push the boundaries of my own creativity by being subversive, authentic, innovative and so beautiful. I will forever be grateful for the community my drag was raised through and I love you. To Abhijeet, Loren, Trey, Eda, Natasha, Tenderoni, Chamilla, Manny, Joshuan, Laila, Bambi, Aunty, Alex and everyone in my chosen family that helped me prepare, I am so thankful and so blessed to have you in my life. Thank you endlessly. To Transit Productions, thank you for these incredible gifts. Producing these videos with a team I trust with these delicate messages has been so liberating and unbelievably healing. You've been an integral part in creating my most prized rewards from this entire experience. To these incredible fans, thank you for joining me on this insane journey! I came home feeling so unsure of my reception and with a lot of unanswered questions and newly formed wounds. I hope you know how incredibly healing every word, every DM, every bit of support has been for those wounds. I love you all so much. And to you- Cordero. You did that! There is so much room for growth and improvement, but take a moment to see how far you've come and what you've accomplished all from being a dance-y little kid and a daydreamer. I'm so proud of you. A love letter to the world and to myself, thank you so much for everything. This is only the beginning. I love you.

New videos every week https://pck.tv/3pOiao8Last Sunday, Oprah interviewed Meghan Markle and Prince Harry about their experience stepping back from the Royal Family. And a lot of the interview was about the pain Meghan has suffered at the hands of the British press. They are truly evil to her. That whole country talks about Meghan like she stole their man, which, uhh, we guess she did. Now, we look at Meghan Markle, and we see a nice lady in well-tailored clothes. But when the press writes about that same woman, all of a sudden, she’s “difficult,” “not appropriate,” “unsuitable as a wife,” and favorite, “uppity.” Wonder why they chose that word…Show Synopsis: Amber showcases her signature smart-and-silly take on the news of the week, responding to it all with a charming, late-night mix of seriousness, nonsense, and evening gowns.#PeacockTV #TheAmberRuffinShow #MeghanMarkle"
